In iustinian's time there would be leit (cf. p. 36) the three modes
enumerated in our passage, viz. legaoy (without distinction 01 form),
delivery (which hed swallovved up mancipation and surrender in court,
and had come 10 be regarded in the above named sense as applicabis to

was only applicable in special circumstances, and loripi temporie praescrip-

Ulpian's original text 01 001 passage would hare probably contained

per mancipationem ael in iare 0010100001. Whether it included per 110011- ¹ ,

11000010 very doubtful. In Vat. Fr. 410 Paulus says expressly ciuili
actione (usae findas) corutitaipoteet, contraditione, qaae iaris gentiam ea ,·
and Gaius (11. 28) denies absolutely the application 01 delivery 10 incorpo-
real rights, and, what is stronger‚ makes no mention in the sueceeding
sections 01 any establishment 01 0 00011001 by any such mode. Gaius'
denial is 01 course strictly accurate. A right cannot be delivered: and in
order 10 remove the ambiguity 01 0 delivery 01 land or 0 chattel to the

usufructuary some formal declaration or agreement 10 necessary. But
whatever preceded, whether mancipation, or surrender in court, or bar-

gains and stipulatione, or bequest, in a will, there would follow (01. p. 36) 1

delivery 01 the thing to be enjoyed, or at least acquiescente by the owner
in the exercise 01 the right by the person entitled to the easement.
And this traditio or qnasi traditio was the basis of the Praetods pro-

the positive lenguage 01 Ρο0100 and the significant omissione 01 Gaius,
it does not seem probable that Ulpian here named per traditionem as 0
constituent mode 01 creating a 00011001, and ranged it with legatum and
copulatio, and presumably with nrancipatio and in iare caesio.
