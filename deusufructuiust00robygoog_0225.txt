heir has actually taken, but what the legates might have taken, is to be

2. 1 d A stipulation fora usufruct or for a slave’s services 1011110 next ten
years is 1101 1 stipulation simply 101 ten years of a usufruct or 01 1 slave's
services, so that it 0111 be fulfilled at any time. Both in form and sub
stance 1 postponed ten years is very different, and probably much less
useful to the stipulator than the ten years next after the stipulation was
made. 111110 years elapso, the ten years stipulated for cannot be given
Still, if the promiser is in fault, he must make amends, and the stipulator
can still sue on the stiprdation for the fulfilment-if not ia specie then in

promiser is in fault (01. D. xxv, 1.182.§1; l 91. §33 1 114, 110), and

Stichi· operas] Either by legacy 01 stipulation a man might acquire 1
right 10 the services 01 another man's slave. In what respecta did this
differ from the usufruct of a 111101 This question is answered in the
Digest respecting the legacy 01 such services. The right was not lost hy
non-use, nor by capolia deminutio, nor by the death 011110 legates, but only
hythe death 01 the slave. The legatae was entitled to hire him out, or
the slave might hire himself out: in either case 1110 legates was entitled
to the wagele.xxx111.2.12). The right does not vest like a usufruct
on 1110 heir’s entrance 011 the inheritance‚ but on the day (being 11111 01
1 subsequent day) on which the services are demanded (D. 111. 7. ra;
1111112. 123 17). The same answer would apply 10 stipuloted services,
except so 111 as the intention 01 the parties might be otherwise. The
operae spoken 01 in the Digest are frequently operae liberti (eg. D.
xxxv111.1; 111. 1. 154. ξ 1; 173. pr). See note onl 12. § 3, p. 88.

the time which has elapsed during the hindranoe. Either qaia per 10
