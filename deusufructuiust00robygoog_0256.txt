produce belonged to the owner of the slave, and consequently went with

'the heir was chargeable with delay, had to be given up along with the
mother (D. xx11. 1. l 14. pr. ; xxx. 191. ξ 7), but whether offspring born
before the vesting of the bequest could be retained by the heir, or must be
given up 10 the legatae, was decided differently by the lawyers. Papinian
held that they must be given up (xxxv1. 1. l 60. (66.) 1 4; cf. xxx111. 7.
le. pn), and Ulpian apparently took the same vfew(xxxv1. 1. 1 23. (22.) ξ 3).
Neratius Priscus and Paulus held that the helr could claim them (xx11. 1.
114. ξ 1; xxxv. 2. 124. ξ 1), and Scaevola decided two cases in the seme
sense, though perhaps the deoisicn was influenced by the precise wording
of the will (xxxn. l 41. 8 10 ; xxx111. 5. l 21). Both Papinian and Paulus
agree in not reckoning partus ancillarum es coming in such cases under
the term 00010100. See Oujac. iu lib.1x.reeporu. Papia. (1v. p. 2441, ed.

in slaves just before. The two last fragments from this 17th book ad
Sabiuuue (l2l,l 23) are coneemed with that. Moreover partus, thoughin lay
writers applied to animels as well as tc children, seeins almost restricted
to the offspring oi women in the law writers. At least Dirksen and
Heumann contain 110 passage in which paetus is used pf animale except

Brutus, but apparently as Ulpian's own. In D. v. 3. l 27. pr. he gives
another, quia 000 temere 00011100 eiua rei 00000 compararetur ut 000001.
