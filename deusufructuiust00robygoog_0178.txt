or to bearet and may be done without consulting the drewee. Such a
transfer was not allowed in Roman law. But 11 instead 01 indoreing, the
drawer got the drawee to accept another bill drawn by a third party,
and this operated as an annulment 01 the first bill, we should have a
procedure analogous to that 01 the Roman novation.

There were however some occasions or modes by which a third party
stepped into the legal position 01 another, as a whole, including its rights
and its obligatione. The two usual and, in the later law, almost the only
occasions were inheritance and adoption. (See Just. 11. 9. ξ 6.) Gaius
(11. 98) enumeratos live such occasions St eei heredes fecti 001101, riae

three forms 01 marriage, aeus, confarreatio, coemptio (Gai, 1.110). Uene

Tac. (Aa. 11. 16) as rarely occurring, and in Gaius' time was used only in
connexion with certain priesthoods (ib. 111), and passed away et latest
with the abolition 01 the old Roman priesthoods by Theodosius, 00.
