230 Fructuary's claim to de secto possession. 160·

utilis attio] The action is 1111111, because the plaintiff is no longer
fructuary. Aeque does not mean that this action is ame like the former,
but that a right of action exists in this case eleo, only it is not given in
express terms but is analogous to that given in the edict.

ξ 1. This section contains nothing to necessitate its reference to
cases of violent eviction like the preceding. The words mmsmmtus petitm
are those used of the regular action for enforoing the right of usufruct,
i. e. the uindicatis mesrsreetes, otherwise called the aetio confessoris (D. vn.
6. 15). There is nothing to imply that the fructuary has been in posses·
sion but rather the contrary. The question 10 this: How far is the right
of the fructuary to be in actual possession affected hya contest between
two claimants of the propriety or by his own right to the usufruct being
in disputet First the principle is referred to that the usufructuary's
action will lie against any possessor whether he has tho propriety cr not
(cf. D. l. 0. atram 0111100000 dominam dumtaxat ia rem actio usufrrmtuamo
competat aa etiem aduersos qeemm's possessorem, quaeritur. 'Et Iulianas
scribit tome actionem 0010011110 quemuis possessorem 'ei competere). Then
two cases are put. (1) The propriety is in disputa hut the usufructuary’s
right is not disputed. ln this cese the disputant who is legally possessor
cf the object must admit the usufructuary 10 the qeese'possessio or deten-
tion. The usufructuary io possessione esse debet (cf. D. xn1.2.110. ξ 1;
152). The disputant who has the legal possession must by our text give
him seeurity not to disturb him. This 10 in fact the condition on which
the praetor assignato one 01 the disputants the legal possession. (2) The
arsufructuary’s right is itself disputed by the possessor (whether the pro-
priety be in dispute or not). In this case the possessor must either give
security to the claimant of the usufruct' for the produce or must allow the
claimant himself to be in possession. Presumably in both ceses the frue-
tuary or claimant of the usufruot will have 10 'give the usual security (1, 2)
for proper use and eventual surrender, but in the second 0000 (2) 110 11111
also have 10 give security for the produce itself if his claim is proved
invalid.

eum oui usus fructus relictus est] These words appear to be part 01
the regular hond and leave the question open who is the rightful fmctuary.
The rightful fructuary‚ whoever he be, is the only person entitled in that
respect to the benefit of the hond.

· quamdiu de iure 0110 probet] ‘until he (the possessor) 1010110 his
right’. Quamdiu with present subj. is in other places also used so as to
be practically ‘ until’ <ι so long as he is proving’=‘until he prove'), infr.

If the possessor fails in his proof, then he is cut 01 the case altogether,
and has no need to give or continue to give security 10 the fructuary‚
