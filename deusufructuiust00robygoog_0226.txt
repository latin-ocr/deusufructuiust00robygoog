isa The subject oi this lew occurs before in 1 12. ξ 2. See the
notes there. Our text states what is non-use: that stated what is usa

uideor rs. tr. retinere] ‘it is held that Ι retainthe mutuom beccum
I am using the price, which, as it were, represents the eunucu, noi
because the purchaser is my deputy ior using it See l 39 ; l 35. ξ 1.

las. non minus habere] ‘not less to have the thing’. Minucia
adverbial.

Habere is a very general word„ D. xny. 1. l 38. ξ 9 Habere dupliciter
carpitur: nam et eum babere dr'cimnr, qui rei domim est et eam qui
dominns quidem non est, sed tenet: deniqne babere rem apud nos dspo-
sitem selemim dicere. It is applicabis to usufruets, ib. ξ 3, where aiter
discussing the covenant for quiet enjoyment (habers libere) usually en-
tered into by the seller to the purchaser, Ulpian proceeds Siquis sorte
non de proprietate sed dc possessione nude cmstrouemiam feccrit uel de
usufrucm aet de asu nei de qao alic iare aas quod damonum est, pelam

Itis only as respecta the question oi forfaiture ior non-uss that
the enjoyment oi the price is equivalent to enjoyment oi the usufruet
isselt

140. In the case oi gift the fructuary retains nothing, so that the
only possible use is the vicarious use by tho donee.

141. Two cases are here named where a usufruct may be established,
though it is at first sight not easy to see where the firmins is. The first
case is that ofa statue or bust ; the second that oi a landed estate which
costs more in keeping up than its produce is worth. The use oi the word
utiliter suggests that some may have doubted not only whether a statue
was capable effractis, but even oi mus, cf. las.

statuae et imaginis] The singularis used as more general than the
plural These two things are often mentioned together, e. g. Plin Η. Ν.
xxxrv. 15 Transiit deinde crs urdpo abique ud effigies manne ...... Transit
et u diis ad bominum natans ctqnc imagines miritis modia· D. xx11. 1. 1 17.

republicae sunt ‚futurae in publicum ponentem L 10.15.pr.; 16 Qui
mutnus eset imagines imperatoris iam emaceratos cmiiicaerint ...... iege Iulia
maiestatis tenemur. The statua was a full-length statue. Imago was a
pertrait or likeness, and might be painted or modelled(Oic.Fem.v.12.
§7) or cast in plaster or wax (Plin. H. N. xxxa 153). The ‘likenessss'
meant here were probably tha bronze or silver busts, which were often
placed in librarios and elsewhere to adorn houses or public buildings, and
are distinguished from the medullione, i. e. shields exhibiting likenesses
in relisi. Of. Suet. Dom. 23 Senias etiam inferri, clipeosque et inopinos
eius (Domitiani) eoram detrahi et ibidem solo affligi (semetra) iubet. lt is

however possible that among ‘likenesses' may be included the wax maske
