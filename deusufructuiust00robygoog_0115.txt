interdicto] There are many occasions on which an immediate inter-
position 01 authority is necessary to secure people in the present enjoyment

01 their rights, real or apparent, instead 01 leaving them to have their rights

1010 temporarily to protect possessors 010 facto, violence and serious com-
plicatione may ansus before the rights 01 the parties can be legally
determined. Hence the Praetor was in the habit 01 issuing on application
injunctions tc do, or 10 forbcar doing, certain things. These injunctions
were called generally interdicta: sometimes positive injunctions were
called 01001010 (Gai. 11. 139; 01. 1423 Just 11. 15. ξ 1). After such an
injunction was issued, -if obediente was not given to it, a judge 011000-
000100 were empowercd by' a formula 10 inquire into the allegation
01 disobediencc, and award possession or damages accordingly (Gai. 11.
140 sq.; 161 00.) After the formulary process was abclished, the mat-

quod ul aut clam] This interdict was 00 called Ι110111110 initiatory
words. As given by Ulpian (D. xnrrr. 111 1. pr.) it ran thus: Quod ai aut
clam scotum eet, qao de ra agilia, id, enar caperratada'pcleataa est, 1001111100.
