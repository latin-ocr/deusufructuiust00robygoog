debet] sc. mafrcctoura'm. The judge has not only 10 assess damages
for past infractione 01 duty, but to give directions for the due use and
enjoyment for the future, and that will comprehend what the usufructuary
must do or refrain from doing, andalao what he may do, i. e. what the
proprietor must permit.

t 2. lege Aquilia] The lec Aquilio, os uncertain author and date, but
conjecturally referred 10 nuc. 467 (Rudorff, a. θ. 1. ξ 41) superseded the
provisions of the Twelve Tables and other statutas, and, being enlarged by
the interpretation 01 the lawyers, was the principal source of actions for
physical injury caused by any malice or fault 01 one person 10 the person
or property 01 another. The cause of action was called damarum inierat
datura, and the action was often called briefiy damni 10111110(00.άα111,01
abusively domm iniuriae. The statute was directed against any one who
slew (occiderit)a slave or four-footed animal specim) belonging to another;
or burnt, broke or tora (0000111, fregerit, ruperit) anything belonging 10
another. The damages were to be measured by the greatest value within
the preceding year in the case 01 slaying, or within the last thirty days in
the other cese. The owner was the person entitled to sue. Denial by the
defendant, if the ease was proved, doubled the damages. (Gai. 111. 210 sqq.;
D.1x.a‚esp.11;121;127.§5; 123.§103129.§8.)

Interpretation, partly by introducing analogous actions inscrtum,

extended the sphera of the remedy in many ways, so as to comprise not .

only slaying, but causing death (e. g. apoisoner, though he did not himself
administer the poison, D. 1. c. 19. pr. ; one who frightened a horse which
threw its rider, though he did not himself push the rider off, &c 19. ξ 3);
not only burning‚ breaking, tec, but any kind of physical damage, 127.
§§ 13-17 ; not only damage done to a slave or animal belonging to one, but
damage done 10 0 child under one's power or to oneself(l 5. ξ 3; 113. pn).
Not only the owner, but also a usufructuary or pledgee, mirld bring the
action or an analogous one (afilia actio 1 11. ξ 10; 130. § l); and tha
value of the thing damaged was taken 10 ,mean all that the owner would
have obtained by means 01 11 (ag. to include an inheritance to which 0
slave was mede heir). D. l. c. 122. § 1-123. ξ 6.

01 offences coming under this law and affecting our present title there
are mentioned, cutting down timber before it was old enough (D. l.c. l 27.
ξ 26); setting fire to the farm-house (ib. §8; ξ 11), or to a wood (cod.
111. 35. l l), pulling down or firing adwelling-house (Ood. ib.12)‚treating
a slave improperly, so 00 10 make him less valuable (D. l.c. 127. ξ 17;
below l 15. ξ 2), or killing or maiming him, 110.
