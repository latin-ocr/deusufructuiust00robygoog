‘the selectiou of the title de usufructu, but Ι have seen no
‘reason for regretting the clroice. There is much iu the doctrine
‘ol ususruct which closely resembles our law of life interests,
‘but there is also much which is specially Roman; and, as will
‘be seen, a good many other parts of the law come naturally
‘into notice in dealing with this. It is also not a little ad-
‘vantage that the corresponding title of the Basilice is one
‘of those which have been edited by Zacharia von Lingenthal,
‘with the Byzantine comments conveniently arranged. The
‘Vatican Fragments contain a number of extracta on Usufruct,
‘which furnish important comparisons with the Digest.

‘The text of the title de usufructu is that of Mommsen,

‘passage in question was concerned, but also as the student
‘might find it in other parts of the Digest. A brief summary
‘of the law on many matters has been given, partly to remind
‘the student of its relation to the particular question in hand,
‘and partly because what may be already familiar to him from
‘the Institutas will be found to assume a somewhat different
‘aspect under different treatment.

‘Having had no predecessore in this particular field of an-
‘notation I have uo special obligations to acknowledge here.
‘Throughout the book I hare tried to take my information
‘from the original sources, and to depend on others only when
‘the matter iu question was large in itself and not closely
‘connected with my subject. WheneverI have made any dis-
‘tinctive use of medem writers, or have thought the reader
