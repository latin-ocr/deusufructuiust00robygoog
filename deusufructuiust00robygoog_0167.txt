master must be presnmed to have in some way been necessary for the entry
of the slave on the inheritance. This is possibly the ground on which
Labeo proceeded in our passage. But it is more likely that Labeo fol-
lowed what was reasonable, without caring whether the act could bs brought
under the old limitation ae operia auis uel er re domiui Labeo’s opinion
was evidently adopted by Justinian (see l 22). It is confirmed by Bas.
But there certamly is a contradiction in words between l 21, l 22 of our
title and the passages of Julian (D. xxxx. 10.) and Paulus (D. xm. L 0.).
Schrader (ad Irest. 11. 9. §4) reconciles them by regarding these last as the
general rulo and our passage as giving the exceptione. Pomponius (in
D. xn1. 1. l 19) in discussing acquisition through a neeman, qui bona
fide milri ceruit says that he does not acquire an inheritance for me, but
that if the intention ol the testator is clear, the inheritance should be
restored to ma See also note on 125. ξ 3 ibai adquirere (p. 169) for a like
view taken by Pomponius in a case of stipulation Such a solution, via
acquisition by the owner with an obligation to restore to the fructuary
would meet the difficulty in our passage, were it not for the positive words
of l 22, ipsi adquiret. .

orbare proprietor. Pernice (Labeo 1. p. 140) suggests that it may have
been done to institute anothers posthumous child as heir; el D. xxvm. 5.
165 (64). Possibly the convenience of a master (or fructuary) absent in
the provinces may have been consulted by appointing a slave who was

. actually present, or could without difficulty be sent there, to enter on tha

inheritance. This however would not apply to the case of legacies.
