and is no more inconsistent with the general right of hunting than the
general law 01 trespass is. The general right of hunting is indeed strictly
considered nothing more than the non-existence 01 private property in wild
animale till caught, and the aeknowledgment 01 the right 01 property in
them when caught.

The usufructuary's remedy to prevent trespass is his regular action

confessorura, justas the owner's remedy is 00110 negatoria. It is said by
writers 01 great authority (eg. Donoll. eunucu. 11. 5. § 24:11. p. 1292,

ed. 1841; Wa'chter Puud. § 134 and Bedupc) that owner and usufructuary.

transposed the Florentius reading sed juretus aut iure 0111 gentium.
1111111111ον1 is in 111111 I think an unusual expression, and the order
with iure is generally reversed (ag. uou 11111 seminis sed iure 1011, D. xx11.
’1. l 25. pn). Moreover its contrast with a somewhat different expression
(iure gentium), and the use of auca applied to aprum 0111 ceruum, 11111 the

singular proprium has been used, are not satisfactory ε but the emendation ·

is simple, and the meaning is supported by Steph. and appears to be right.
Sohirmer l. c. discusses whether the ius fruetus and iungentium are oon-
current or mutuallyexclusive grounds, and decides 101 the latter alternative
as required by the use of aut...uut, instead 01 uel...uel‚ or pertimuerim.
The ius fructus is therefore, according to him, to apply where the fructus
feudi 11 1101111011 constat (D. xxn. 1. l 116),111(11111 ius gentium in all other
cases. But the ius ycutium must apply in all cases and is therefore
concurrent in the case specially mentioned. Aut...uut implies that the
two rights are different (therefore not uel...uel) and that they 111 each
