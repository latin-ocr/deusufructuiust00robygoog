, 126. us. ir. interierit] i.e. by the fructuery's death, or ‘head
breaking', 66 non-user, or expiration 61 time 166 which 66616661 was
granted.

quod superest ad prop. pertinebit] When the leesor sold the pro- · ·

perty leased, or when in any other way his right in the property 6666616
an end before the expiration 61 1166 lesse, the leasc also came strictly
to an end, the lessee bevinges 6 6616 1616 action (en 6666616616) against the
166666166 his breaeh 61 66616661 (D. xlx. 2. l 25. ξ 1 ; 1 33 ; Ood 1v. 65.
1 9). The 166666 could not be forced to continue the occupatiori (Ι). ib. 166),
but continuence on the part 61 both parties even without express agree-
ment operated ns 6 renewal (l 32; 1 13. §113 114). Α fructuary (66 1616
heir), 11 1166 lesse was ended by 1166 loss 61 1166 66616661, was liable only if

· he hed represented himself 66 1166 owner (l 9. ξ 1). The case in the text is

however distinguished from ordinary cases, where the intended duration of
the 16666 may be in exccss of the lcasing power, by 1166 1661 that the slave
6666 act 66 66 agent 61 1166 proprietor as weh as 61 the fructuary (see above,

125. ξ 2), and thus the 16666 666666 16 1166 benefit 61 1166 fructuary until
the usufruct lapsas, and then 6161116 16 1166 proprietor 166 the remainder
61 1166 term (quod superest). A usual period 166 6 lesse 61 land was
five years (quinquennium, l 9. §13 124.§n,§4; insscuingi 13. ξ 11),
probably on the precedent 61 the censor's letting 61 public lands and
taxes.

‘Apportionment' does not mean more than ί6661361686 part' and
therefore is not open 161116 objection which Wiichter (1161616679) makes
in the 6666 611166 German Vertheilung ‘division between two 66 more per-
6666 ’, viz. that it is properly applied only 16 66616 6 cese es that in our text,
where the 16666 continues, notwithstanding the change in the person who
has the leesing power. 16 611666 ceses, 6. g. where a fructuary has him·
6611 leased 6 farm or 6 166666 66 6 slave’s services, the lease is at an end by
the lapse 61 1166 fructuarys right. The proprictor can ii he likes turn out
the lessee, and enjoy the land, &c himself, or make euch new terms as 166
chooses And so with a sale 611166 land lessed, 111166 lesse is not
noticed in the contract 61 sale. The question 61 apportionment 616661 will
in any case arise inthis form. What can the fructuary legally claim from
the lessee, 11 1166 lease 66 1166 fructuary‘s interest in it lapse before the 1611
term 61 1166 contracti The answer is, that it depends on whether the
666166 weges or other periodical payment 61 1166 lessec is remuneration
1661166 lessec’s taking the natural produce 61 1166 thing let, orior the
lessee’s use 611166 thing (Witchter, 1. 6. ; Elvers, p. 436), In the first 6666,
e. g. an agricultural farm, the fructuary can claim only the produce
gathered while the usufruct lasted. Ι1 11 be gothered‚ it, 66 1166 lessee's
payment in respect 61 11, belongs to the fructuary, though the day 166
