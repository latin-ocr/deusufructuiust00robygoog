thief, this action would be useful, if the thief had par-ted with the stolen
property before action brought (cf. D. x11. 1. l 11. § 2 fin).

(1) A condictio was brought to recover what had wrongfully become
the property of another. A atudr'aotor claimed what was his own property
but was wrongfully detained from him by another: he must essert 1111
utam eoae. A woclictor admitted that the property was in another: but
claimed that the defendant rem dore oportere. As theft did not change the
property in the thing stolen, it was really an abusa of the condictio to
allow it to be brought against a thief, and Gaius admits this, and only
excuses it 1111ορ11111 (Gai. IV. 4). 11 truth the positive law against theft's
chauging the property could not alter the natural consequenoes of the act :
if the thief mingled the stolen money or the goods with other of the same
kind, identification became impossible; and if he consumed the stolen
goods, that was no reason for defeating the ownerfs right to restitution
(cf Savigny Syat. V. Beil. xr11. 15). But if the owner parted with his
property in the stolen goods, his right to bring a condiction lapsed
(D. x111. l.l 10. § 2). Γ11111111 of the action was the recovery of the stolen
thing, or, failing that, its velue, with its fruita and incidental advantages
(id 11111111111911111,11. 13). A condiction could be brought only by
the owner who had been robbed, and only against the actual thief or his heir
or heirs (in proportion to their shores, l 9). The destruction ol the thing
stolen or death 11 1 slave stolen did not defeat this action as it defeated
vindication (ib.17; D. xnvn. 2. 146. pr.; Gai. 11. 79). Recovery of the
thing, or damages obtained in one of these last two actions, was a bar to
the other being brought (D. xnvn. 2. l 9). ’ Α practical distinction between
the three actions is given in D. 111. 1. l ll 1711111111 reamini porram ei ·
eatae& 111 ai dolo 11111 (11111111 possidat, od exhibendam a9i; qaod ri
riae dolo malo 1111111111, 1111111111 tibi potero.

Both in 1111111111 and 1111111111, under the formulary system, the oon·
demnation ‘sounded in damages ', i. e. it was expressed in the formula as
money: but this condemnation was actually passed, only if restitution of
the thing claimed and its accessories was refused or impossible (Gai.1v.48;
1143 cf. Just. 11. 17).

(d) An action for theft (111111 forte) was not intended to restore to
the owner the thing stolen or its equivalent‚ but to inflict 1 heavy penalty.
A successful plaintiff recovered twice the greatest ralue of the stolen thing,
or, if the thief was caught in the act, fourfold such value (Gai. 111. 189, 190 ;
D. xnvn. 2. l 50. pr). This aetion was wholly independent of vindication
or condiction, and could be brought and the penalty recovered, even after
recovery of the thing and its accessories had been obtained in either of
those actions. Nor was success in this action any bar to either of those
being brought subsequently (ib. 155. §33 Ood. v1. 2. lia. ξ l). This
action lay against the thief, his advisere and accomplices (Gai. 111. 202; D.
xuvn. 2. l 50. §§ 1-3). Theft was defined as a fraudulent handling for the
sake of gain, either of a thing, or of the use or possession of a thing
