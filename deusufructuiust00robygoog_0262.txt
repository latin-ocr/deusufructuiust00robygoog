tionary state, who is ιο claim theml Ipresume the fructuary's heir
would, because they heve not yet been incorporated into the herd. (But
01. l 25. ξ l.) And in the same way 11 they are stolen, the fructuary could
bring the 0000111110 because they have not yet been incorporated. I doubt
whether Julian, whose view is approved by Ulpian, really meent that the
property was 101 the time ownerless, absolutely ic penitentiam not that
it was not finally decided. It is better to interpret his words in a sense
quite suitable to the notion 01 pendens ciminium, but suitable also ιο the
practica] necessities 01 the position. Pendeat is properly applied to
property vested in an owner 101 the time, though it may be liable on the
occurrence 01 an eventtobedivested in favour 01 another. Thisview makes
Julian’s statement consistent with Pomponius in l 69 and with l 70. ᾖ 2.
Wtichter (Parui. 1. ξ 69, p. 344) holds that in this single case of animale
born when the herd is not 11111, there is still (in Germeny) such a thing as
property in suspense, but that all other alleged cases have become· 111111100-
11001, and that even in this the practice 01 German 00111ιο does not recog-
nise it. Vangerow Parui. ξ 301 also allows it (es well as some others). ’

ξ 1. carnem setus, dtu] The young when alive was the property 01
the fructusry, not merely the object 01 0 usufruct: it was his cs produce
01 the herd: hence the 0010000 belongs ιο him also. In D. 111. 4. 130110
have a different case, cero etcertum mortui peeoris infreme 000 011, qrrc'c
Ι mortuo eo ruossmretus extinguetur, i. e. a usufruct in a herd 01 cattle does
not carry with it 0 right to the carcase. The fructuary has no power 01

nihil supplebit] ie. he will not be bound to supply anything.· -11 an
individual animal or thing is lest him in usufruct, the fructuary can use it

in 0 proper way, and, 11 it die, he loses his usufruct but is in no way bound
ιο replace it. If a herd is left him, he has ιο keep the herd in good condi-

tion and thus to keep up its numbers out 01 1ιο own produce. But if
some pestilence were te destroy the herd, the fructusry would not be
bound to purchase others to keep up the herd. His only obligation is to
deal with the hend as a good man 01 business, and not to take 01 its fruits,
i. 0. the young, so thoughtlessly or greodily as to prevent or endanger the
continuance 01 the herd. ’

14. The csse put in this section is this: The herd is 11111 111 number,
and young are born: there is no obligation resting on the fructuary, and
the young 010 his property. Some vacancies occur in the herd. Does the
occurrence 01 these vacancies put 0 present obligation on the fructuary, so
that he ought at once ιο put some 01 the young definitely into the herdy
