exercere] ‘train'. Bas. translates γυμνάζειν, i.e. ‘train 101 public
shows ’. Perhaps hunting like the Windsor stag-huma, so as not to kill or
hurt, might come under the word. Noodt 1. cap. 'ltakes it in the same
sense as 11111111 exeruere (D. IV. 9. 1 l. ξ 2), cauponam ael 1111111111 exercere
(ib. ἓ 5), fodinae 11111111 (h. t. l 13. ξ 5), exercere possessionem feodi
(D. xxxin. 7. l 12. pn), ie. 10 work for profit. But this would not naturally
be suggested byferas eeercere.

possit] The sentence may be regarded as a dependent question, as we
say, ‘query, whether we may hunt them but may not kill them ³. It
is however simpler to take possit and siet as hypothetica] subjunctives.

alias] attracted into the case of quae, and hence lice is expressed with
the apodosis. Aliae would have been simpler.

initio] ie. ‘at the commeneement of the usufruct'. As however
the same principles would apply 10 any other additions to the menagerie
during the course 01 the usufruct‚ Mommsen suggests that initio has been
wrongly inserted as a eontrast to post, which last alone is supported by
Bas. In the stereotype edition he suggests, as an alternative reading, inibi
101· iaitio. But see nent note hut one.
