receiver. The expression is common, eg. Gai. 11. 81 Siquando 1811111
1111111111 pecuniam alicui riae latmia auctoritate dederit, facit eam acei-

plus pretium] ‘more than the price'. This use 81 ples instead 81 ·

plusquam is common with numerals (Lat. Gr. 1273111111 not with words
like pretium. So that it is better perhaps to take plus here es an ed-
jective end translate the phrase ‘an excessive price’. For pluria prediis
occasionally found in thissense in classica] writers, and in D. 111 6. 126
we have maioris pretii res in §4 corresponding to oleam pluris pretii in 1 5.

not the agreement was null (Gai. 111. 140-1433 J ust. 111. 23. 11 ; 24. 11).
With the language in the 1811 compare Gai. 111. 142 Nisi mercer certa statuta
sit, acu uidetur locatio et corcducte'o contradi; D. 1111. 1.152 Locatio siae
mercede certa contrahi noa potest. Both speak 81 merces, and merces like
pretium, as is generally held, must be in money. This is supposed to follow
from the following passages, D. 111111 l. 19; 1111.1.11.14; 111515.
§23 Iret. 111. 24. 12; Theophil. 11111111. 24111. καὶ ὥσπερ εἰρήκαμεν ἐκεῖ,

mitted certainly 81 the merces 181 a farm being in a quantity 01· proportior
of the produce, eg. Liv. 11111. 3 Capuae Flaccus 181111 princepum aea-

anai locasti. An arrangement 181 taking part 81 the rent in kind is men-
tioned in D. 111. 2. l 19. 13. This exception from the general rule is
generally admitted (see the discussion in Gl'uck 1111. p. 327 sqq), but in
truth it is only Theophilus who definitely lays down the rule. In the
other passages it may fairly be held that the' question 81 measurable pro·
duce was not present to the writers. Compensation for the use 81 a thing,
if agreed to be made in some other form than money or measurable produce
