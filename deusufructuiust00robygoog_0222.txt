13181. Reservation of usufruot. 207 .

often represented es holding: Scyphos Herculis 00001010 est (Maerob. v. 21.
ξ 16 commentingou Verg. Aeo. vm. 278). 1091000 astabat scyphus (Tibull.
Ι. 10. 8); scyphum 00010001 (Suet Claud. 32), cf. Trebell. 010001. 17; Beck-
er’s 001100, ed. Gdll. 111. p. 407.

deinde massa iacta, 110] ‘if they had then been reduced 10 a mere
mass 01 metal ; and then again made into bowls'.

pristim qualitas scyphorum] ‘the former character 01 bowls'. Sey·
phorum is probably a genitive of definition (Gr. 1. 1302).

nontamen 1110110000] ‘still (be considered) they were not 1110 1101110,
the usufruet of which had been boqueathed’.

ξ 1. A verbal eontract is made for an estete, the promiser reserving
the usufruot. What is the import 01 this reservationl Is it simply
for the benefit of the promiser, and consequently on his death does it
fall to the proprietyl or has the promiser a power 01 appointment to
he exercised 111 favour 01 anyone whatever thet he choosesi The
usual cese was to reserve simply 101 01100011, but 11 the reservation
was in gross there is nothing to restriet it 101110 promiser‚ and the
event only can shew decisively3 01154. 80 with the reservation 01 an
urban servitude: if the seller of a house declares in the sale 001000 fore
aedes, 001 suis oedibus 001 ceruos fecere potest 001 010100 concedere 00101-
10100 (D. 1111. 4. l 6. ξ 30). 80 much for the contract. But when eii'eet
eomes to be given 10 the coutraet by the eonvcyanee, the reservation or
declaration 01 servitude must be express: the house or person, in whose
favour the servitude is constituted or reserved, must be stated (ib).
In our text the promiser dies before eonveyanee. If the reservation
was simply for himself, the usufruot reverte ou his death to the pro-
priety, and the person who had duly contracted for the propriety is
entitled 10 demand from the promisere heir eonveyanee 01 the whole
estate without deduction 01 the usufruct: if it was a reservation in gross‚
then he can only demand eonveyanee of the propriety.
