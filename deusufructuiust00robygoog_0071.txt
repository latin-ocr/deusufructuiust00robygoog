the person so sent subjected the offender to an action 10 fartam and also
t'o 011 interdictae 011 fiat (D. 111111. 4). .

· causa damni infecti] The owner or lawful occupier of 0110110001101111,
which stood in danger 01 damage from the defective condition (0111010) 01
another buildingor other land, was allowed by'the Praetor to demand
security from the owner, superficiary, fructuary, pledgee, 110. 01 the ruinous
building or land against the danger apprehended, though not yet done
(01000001 infectam). The security required was in the case 01011 owner his
own formal promise (repromissio), in the case 01 most others, including
a usufructuary (1111111111. 2. l 9. ξ 5) was the formal promise 01 0111010 (salah
datio) as well. If security was not given within the time fixed hythe
praetor, he gave the complainant the right to oooupy (10 possessionem ire)
the dangerous property without however ejecting the owner (1 15). He is
allowed, but is 1101 obliged, to prop up cr repair the dangerous building,
810, and is entitled to his costs (115. 1131131). 111110 owner abandons
the property or still refuses 10 give security, the Praetor on finding
‘sufficient ground in these or other facts (00010 cognita), decreed the
effective possession (00101100) 10 the complainant, 0 possession which in
due time ripened into ownership (l 15. ἑξ 16, 21). This is compared by
Ulpian to the 00000 deditio euthorised 111 the case 01 slaves who have
'committed 1011017. § 1. The words 01 the edict are given in l 7. pr.
0111101 title. See also Lea 11010. 20 (Bruns p. 91).

’ The order 01 the words is irregular, the ablative caasa being rarely
prefixed to its genitive either in olassieal or in law Latin It does so
occur however in Ter. Eua. 2023 Suet. Aug. 24. None 01 the passages
in Livy, given by Klotz Les. 01., have this order, at least in Madvigs
edition. See his houd. od Lio. 111. 41. § ll (p. 474).

· iure dominii poss] ‘possess as owner ⁷. So also D. xxxrx. 2. l 15. ξ 33.
By the first decree he would only 10 possessione csse, i.e. have merely the
custody of the house: by 1110 second decree he would actually possess
(possidere) with the intention 01 holding as owner ; and after the expiration
of the prescribed time (000 dn l 5), would gain the real ownership, 01. D. 1111,
