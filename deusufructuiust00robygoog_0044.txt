, applicabis to all praedae· A senate's deoree however, passed cu the
proposal 01 Nero, eured this defect in practice, and· declared that, even if a
thing hed not belonged tc the testator, it might pass by this form of
bequest, as well as if it had been 101111 the form mostwidely applicabis.
Such 0 form was the legacy per domnatvbocm, by which the heir was bound
to convey the property¹ in the thing bequeathed to the legatae, whether it

was or was 10111101001010101111100111010010111 any sense. 11 it belonged ⁴
to some one who would not part with it, the heir was liable 101 the velue

(Gai. 11. 202; D. xxxrr. 1 1111). The legates had by the will no property
iu the thing bequeathed: he hed only 0 claim on the heir to procure it
and convey it. It is clearly this form 01 bequest that 10 here referred 10 as
applicable to all praedia (see note on 10100101 dure, p. 34). 01 this view the
1100. 01 cuniam has an intelligible force, and the words may therefore have
,11001 written by Gaius as the Digest gives them. Indeed Ulpian mv,
ἐξ 7, 8, after describing per uindicationem lepori, proceeds Per damnationem
010000 res legaripoasuut etiam qaae 000 sunt 1001010110, dum 100110101οε atat
quae dori possint. This parallel gives strong support to the above view.

“ , (d) Ηο000’(111101’0. Mus. 1. pp. 110 sqq.) and Arndts (iu Gliick’s Pond.
¹ xuvr. p. 19, 1010) suggest that Gaius wrote prouincialium (praediorum) and
that Tribonian substituted omnium. This supposition derives scrne
support from its affording a ready explanation 01 the next sentence. If ,
(10111010 speaking only 01 provincial land, the mention 01 bargulus and
. stipulatione as the mode 01 constituting a usufruct inter 01000 becomes
intelligible (see Gai. 11. 31). Otherwise we must suppose 0 considerable
omission by Tribonian (see p. 35). This view 01 Ηο000’0 10010 however on
the principle, generally held, that bequest by vindicatiou (whether 01 the
· property 01 cfthe usrrhuct) was not applicabis 10 provincial land (except 01
'course such 00 had received Italic rights, Plin. 111. § 253 ξ 139; Savigny
Verre. Sota 1. p. 30 sqq.). Laud iu the provinces was not capable 01
mancipation (Gai. 11. 15) ; 101 01 surrender in court (ib. 31), 101 01
1101000101 (ib. 46). So much is certain : but I find no such express state*
1101100 regards vindication: end legacy by vindication and surrender in
0011111010 not always like incidents (Vat. Fr. 49). But iu vindication, as
in mancipaticn aud surrender in 001111, the claimant had 10 essert thet the
thing was 1110001010 Quiritium aud bequest pel· uindicatrboem was appli-
cable only 10 things which were the essars ec iure Quiritium. So that

the question is, eould a Roman citizen essert that land in the provinces (in · '

places not specially exeepted from the 'ordinary provincial law by being
made Italici 10111) was 1110001010 (9011111001 Now the rights enjoyed by ¹
