might have done either by express words (supr. l 19. pr.) 01 by necessary
implication (D. xxx111. 3 11).

Marcellus ecnbrt] The passage of Marcellus referred to isin D. v111.

2. l 10.
alteras altius tollendo] Every person is able to do what helikes in
raising 01 lowering or altering his own house, unless his house is subject
to a servitude in favour of another. Cum eo, qui tollendo obscurat uicini
aeder, quibua nou seruiat, nulla competit actio (Ι). 1111219 ; 010011. 111. 34.
18 ; 19). The servitude ne aeder altius tollantur is spoken 01 as a ius non
tollendi, 1. e. a right 111 the dominant house, that the neighbour should not
raise his house. But a ius 1011011111 is also spoken 01 (Gai. 11. 31 ; D.V111.
212110.)οε a servitude (and similarly a iua non auertendi stillicidii as
well as a 1111 auena-ridi). It is not easy to accountfor what is apparently
part 01 the regular rights 01 an owner being treated as a servitude. Two
explanations are given, (1) that the ius tollendi is a special privilege
by which a neighbour is bound to waiva in favour 01 another the claim
he hes by any general restrictions on buildings in towns to prevent·
such higher erections. (So W'eichter, Pand. § 158, Beil11.andothers.)
(2) That after a house has boen subject toa servitude 110 altius tollamur,
it can only recover its freedom by a contrary servitude being imposed
ou the dominant house. Hence the seruitus non 1011011111 rs removed

officere luminibus] The us. reading obscurare luminibus must be
wrong, as the verbis transitive. The origin of tho error is clear, if the
extract from Marcellus’ Digest 111 D. vr11. 2. 1 101s looked at. Inthe state-
ment 01 the question to Marcellus the words are berea aedes 0110101 dam
roua et ,111111111ίό111 tud officit. In the answer of Marcellus the words
are non dubium eat quin berea 01100 poerit abtim tollendo obscurare
lumina legatarum aedium ; and lower down aed ita officere luminibus
et obscurare legatae aedes conceditur, ut non pertitus lumen recludo·
tur aed tantum relinquatur quamum ruffini babitantibus iu nsua diurni
moderatione. Some copyist has confused the two phrases officere
luminibus and obscurare lumina. Either will do 111 0111 passage. Ι
pref er officum lnnriuibua because obsanare' rs so likely to have been sub·
stituted by some one who sees it occur twice 1n our passage immediately
after. Were it not for the extract from Marcellus, obstruere would be an
easy correction for obscurare. See above 1 13. ξ 7, and note there (p. 112).
Perhaps, however, obstruere is more suited to actual blocking up 01 win-

dows than to the prejudicial effect 01 othererections, and officere is per-
petually used in the Digest in. the sense required. Bas. 1101101011(εο τὰ
doira which looks. like obscurare, but steph. ἐμποδίζειν τοῖς φῶσι with
σκοτισθέντα used afterwards, which Itake to indicate that Steph. read
officere luminibus.

The comparison 01 our passage with the extract from Marcellus shows
