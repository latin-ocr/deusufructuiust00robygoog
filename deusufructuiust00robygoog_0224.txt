131152. Per aliquem stare, quominus, 10. More. 209

See l 47: 01. D. xxxnr. 2. 1 6, where the caseis put 01 0 legacy 01 0
usulruct for two years only, and the heir delays till the two years have
expired. The usufruet bequeathed cannot now be sued for; any usufruct
for another two years would be another usufruct and 001 1101 boqueathed.
But the heir is liable for the velue. In our text two ceses are taken, first
the death 01 110 slave, 10. 110 destruction 01 110 object 01 usufruct'3
secondly the death 01 110 intended fructuary.

cum perheredem staret 00001000, &o.] The subjunctive (staret) is
here used 10 denote what I have called (hat. Gr. ξ 1720) ‘an essential part
01 110 history ', not a cause. ‘The heir being· in default for not giving
01100110 the 1000001 ². Per miqcem stare (fieri, fore) quominus is the
regular phrase for making default in the performance 01 0 duty, 01 1 37;
D. 11. 8. 1 8. ξ 4; x111. 5. l 16. 11 2, 3; 118. pr.; X1x.13121.§3,&c. See
note 00 1 19. pr. p. 145. It is 001 necessary that the heir or promiser,
dm, should by act or neglect hinder his due performance: default does
not imply positive fault: non-performance of the obligaticn puts the
person obliged in default. unless he can shew some unexpeeted objectiva
hindrance. Not having 110 money is no valid excuse for not paying what
one has promised or is otherwise bound 1ο pay. It is 00 imemnmodum -
personae, not 00 impedimentum maturate (D. xxm 1. l 137. ξ ).

aliud dici, &o.] ‘he says there is no roem for any other opinion than
that the heir is bound 00 iar 00 1110, viz. in the amount 01 interest which
the legates had in the absence 01 delay'. Of. 1). xxx. 139. § l Ipsius
pemque rei interitum poet morum debet, sieut 10 stipulatione, si pest moram
res interierit, aestimatio 0100000001οΗ xuv, 1. 182. ξ 1; x11. 2. l 30. 1 1.

quanti leg. intersit] Cf. 147. The measure 01 damage is not simply
the market velue 01 110 slave's services for the time, but 110 1000 01110
legates from 001 having him. And this might be considerably more, 00
there is the possibility 01 110 fructuary obtaining legacies 0r inharitances
through him (122). of. D. rx. 2. 121. ξ 2; 122.

moram] 1100010 used both in the ordinary sense of delay in general,
and 10 110 1001010οΙ sense 01 delay for which one is answerable, 10. default.
They both occur in D. xx11. 1124 Si 0010001011001 quidem eteorum sccii,
iudicium cutem accepere paratus fcit, 000 uidetur fecisse morem. Mera is
not default unless the due day has arrived (dice uemit); nor usually, in the
absence 01 special stipulabor, unless the creditor hes applied for payrnent3
(on this disputed point see Vangerow Pcad. 111. p. 1863 Wdchter Pcmd.
ξ 192, 11. p. 397). Of. ib. l 32 mora fleri intellegitur mom entered experrectu,
101 eet si interpellatus oportuno 1000 mem 0010011 ; 'qaod apud iudicem 000001-
mabitcr...cum sit mcyis sacti qua-m iuris. Excuses are sometimes admis-
sible (ib. l 21-1 23; 000. 1. 1 91).

ex eo tempore] 10. 110 time when delay first occurred (cf. just below
ee ee tempere quo mora eit facta), i.e. the time when the conveyance of the
usuiruct was due and was not made.

ususfructus aestimetur] In valuing the produce, 001 only what 110
