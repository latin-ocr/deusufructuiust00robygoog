id campanariae, non praedii est] This emphatic expression ia
perhaps due to the 1001 1101 Pomponius’ 33rd book related to rights ⁴
and easemcnts connected with land. At least all the fragments from it as
collected by Hommel (except one, D. xx11.5.lll) have this connexion.
But such rights could be created only in favour 01 another estate;
and that 001010 must be the creator’s own, not a strangers. Consequently
0 man delivering the only estate which he owned, could nst 1000110 any
predia] right, 10110 had no estate 1011 which it could serve (D. vm. 4. l 1.
§13 16. pn). But a persona] servitude he might reserve. Such are
0000 fieretur and 0000, hahitatio being only a special form 01 0000, and
pactio, 001010 used, a special form 0100010000.

Iul 4 Papinian says, if the estate 01 110 owner 01 110 servitude 10 mainly
a mttle-breeding farm, the 101 pascendi and iae 001 aquam appellandi are
servitudes to his 001010 101101 than to himself, but that 11 110 testatore
words described a particular person as entitled, the heir or purchaser (01
110 estate) will not have a right 10110 servitude. Stephanus draws a
distinction between a herd kept 101110 value 01 110 produce and one kept
merely 1ο provide manure ior an 001010. A right 01 pasturage in the
former case is personat, in the latter predial In our passage it cannot be
predial, 101 the servitude owner has no estate: he has parted with the
property in a mountain pasture, retaining to himself merely 110 right 01
paetnring his herd there. Pasturage applies 10 sheep, goats‚ swina, oren,
101000, asses and mules (ci. Varr. R. a. 11. 1. ξ 12, ξ 16).
