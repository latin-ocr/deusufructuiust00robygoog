forsitan etiam haec, &o.] The differenoa 01 this case from that in § 4
10 clear. In that section the fructuary of an ornamental estateisforbidden
to convert it into an estate worked merely 100 profit. In this section a
farm worked 100 profit is assumed: the fructuary is allowed 10 work mines
previously opened, anderen 10 open new ones, 11 11 can be done without
interiering with the regular farming 01 an estate. Then comes the ques·
tionz what 11 the mines, if 00100101, should be more profitable than the
farm continued as of old? Ulpian says somewhat doubtfully (10000100)
that possibly the transformation (partiat or entire) 01 the estate from
farming to mining may be allowed. The whole circumstances 01 the case
would have to be weighed‚ and the act of the iruetuary in changing the
character of the estate, 001 from a residential estate 10 0 profitable one,
but from onemode 01 profitable workingto another, may be justified. This
interpretation seems 10 ba confirmed by Bas. divavar δὲ carmin ἐν τῷ

There has been a grean deal 01 discussion about the passage from early
times, which may be seen in Gliiok 1x. p. 239 sqq„ and Vangerow, Paracl.
§ 344, Anm. 2(v01. 1. p. 736). Both these writers understand the passage
tc 001010 10 only a partini transformation 01 the 001010, ie. to a change 01
some portione 01 the estate from vineyard 10 mine. So also Elvers Serv.
p. 472, Wtichter, Parui. § 154 (11. 233). ido not feel sure that the limita-
tion 10 0 part 10 necessary. That view seems 10 0001 partly on a somewhat
strained application 0100100 adsumta inl 1 (which I take merely 10 dis-
tinguish a 000000100 from a quusi-asaafructaa), and partly 00 applying
here what Ulpian says only of 0 residential 001010 (supr. § 4). But very
likely the pertial 100001000011000100 001010 would be more easily justi·
fied than a completa change. Yet 11 00 unsuspected bed 01 minerals were
found and 011 the neighbouring estates were worked for that, an entire
transformation might ba what a boras paterfamilias would do and approve.
Nothing seems 10 be said 01 the course 01 obtaining the bare owner's con-
sent. But that must have been possible, and might create an obligation:
it would 001 affect the absolute legal rights. Seenotecn 1 15 fin. (p. 125).
