166 Capitis diminutio or deminutio? 125. ξ 2.

p. 274). The Vat. Fragments, §.i 60-64, though much mutilated, appear
to agree with Gaius: having several times diminutio (for which the Digest
often substitutos minutio), once (at 11111) minutio. Ulpian and the Floren-
tino ns cf the Dignst have deminutio, deminutus, minutii), minui, minutus.

ing 1ο modern editions we hove Cic. Pop. 4. § 18 11 eapite deminuit ;

(b) The origin of the phrase is uncertain. Plautus (e. g. Men. 304, Most.
2663 doc.) has diminuam eaput cf 1 threat ‘to break a person's head' in
the literal sense. Caput is often used metaphoricclly 01 1 man’s life or
personal existence, c. g. in such phrases as de litero cupite iudicare, coruom
eapitis dieue, certamen cupitis et sunone, damnare cupitis (sc. iudicio 1), death
or banishment being the result, ifthe accused were condemned (D. xxxvn.
14. l 10). Hence ‘head-breaking’ (diminutio) may have been the original
expression, afterwards softened, or perhaps corrupted (11 eaput 1011 its vivid
original meaning, and became a name fora congeries of rights) into ‘head-
lessening', ‘head-abating’ (deminutio or minutio. For this use of de·
minuere, cf. D. xxxm 8. l 6 pr. deminui simpulo corporo pro ento debebam).

(o) A man’s caput cr personality as a member of a community, and
thereby entitled to legal (1011-1101111111) rights, included as its basis
freedom, citizenship, and membership 01 afamily. Aslavehad noonpm: .

free stranger was as such not entitled to marry with, or inherit from, 1
Roman to hold property in Reman land, or enter into commercial dealings
under the same forms and securities 11 1 Roman. The ius ciuile was for
Romans only. Further, the Roman state was an aggregate, not of indi-
viduale but of familias. A member 01 1 Roman family was necessarily a
freeman, and 11 1 member was 1 citizen. There were thus three degrees
cf ‘ head-breaking '. Loss of freedom carried with it the loss of citizenship
and family-membership: it was 11111111 cupitis demin-atio. Loss cf
citizenship but not of freedom was 1 minor cop. dem. ,· 1111111 carried with
11101101 family membcrship. Lcss 01 this last without ceasing to be free
or a citizen was minimo cup. dem. It was not mere loss either. He 1011
his place in one family, because he became-a member of another. And
hence cupitis deminutio generally (D. iv. 5. l 1 ; 01. Gai. 1. 152) and minimo
cop. dem. in particular (Ulp. 11. ξ 13) were called status permutatio. For
minor cop. dem the term medicis also used (Gai. 1. 159; D. 1v. 5.111);
and both the two first-named are called moyuu o. d. (1111111111111.

M. Ochn (Beitntpe, 11. pp, 45-73). Medio cop. dem. was according to Gaius
brought about by the prohibition 01 the use 01 fire and water, 1ο which
