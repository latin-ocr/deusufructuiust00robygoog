We must not take fecere with it, but understand rejicere. ’ For to plaster

la quamuis melius repositurus sit] ‘although he purpose re-
placing it with something better'. He must not change the character oi
the house even though he improve it; but improvements ol a minor cha-
racter may be made. It is difficult to draw the line between what is
forbidden here, and what is allowed in l 13. §§ 4, 7. Circumstances 111
the particular case would really decide.

19. pr. qmmndmmdonascttuaae] The same double delinition
occursio l 59. ξ l (Paulus). The two parts supplement one another. Nos·
citur might confine fruits to animal or vegetable products (though the
term isused of islands, § 4, and renascitur of marble, D. xxiv. r.·1 133 s'o
also riurei commonly in Pliny) ; and percipe¹ potest, besides being in itself
more general, directe attention to the essential condition oi the usufruc-

ipsius fluctus est] Who or what is psius? Is fractae genitive or
nominative? I incline to translate ‘is produce oi the farm'. But other
translations are possible, e. g. ‘is oi (i. e. included under) actitat produce ' ;
