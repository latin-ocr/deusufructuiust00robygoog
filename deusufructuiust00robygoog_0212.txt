133. 10 0 usufruct 0 part of the ownership? 197

would have been the same, except for the temporary separation 01 the usu-
fruct. The testatore heir gete nothing in either 0000 (apert 01 course from
the question 01 the Falcidian law). A stronger case is put in D. vn. 6. l 4.
There a man bequeaths 011 001010 less the usufruct, and bequeaths the
usufruct 1ο another on condition. What becomes 01 tho usufruct in the
time before the condition takes effect 'l Is it with the heir or with the
legatee 011110 estatel Julian decided that notwithstanding the words
detracto confracta the heir took nothing, the proprietcr would have the
usufruct till the condition existed. It must be remembered that 11 such
words had not been used, the legates 01 the estate would hate been entitled
to the usufruct jointly with the legatee 01 the usufruct (D. xxxnr. 2. l 19),
which would have been contrary to the testator's intention.

§ 1. non partis effectum optinere] ‘in some 00000 the usufruct,
it is agreed, is not treated in law 00 0 part (01 the thing) is treated ’. Bas.
has οὐκ ἔοικεν ἡ χρῆσις τῷ μέρει τῆς δεσποτείας. Similarly Oyrillus. Momm-
sen suggests that we should read noa partia proprietatis; and the inferior
1100. 11ον0, instead 01 noa partia, either proprietam or aon proprietatis. Ι
(10 1101 think any change is necessary, but take partis to be partia rei. A
usufruct is not like a part, for a part follows in some cases the fate of the
other part, whereas a usufruct is independent. The question is not here,
how far the usufruct can be regarded 00 part 01 the ownership (see note on
14. p. 41). 111 0 practical sense itis so: the usufructuary actually enjoys
many 01 the rights which the proprietor would otherwise enjoy, and in
particular has the actual possession and produce 01 the thing. But he is
not a part owner, nor is he owner 01 part 01 the thing. The owners rights
apply equally to all parts 01 the thing owned, and his title to one part 10
the same as his title 10 another part. A usufruct is not 0 whole in this
sense; it is rather a series of acts of enjoyment and the loss 01 0110 such
act does not necessarily preclude his title to aiter acts. 1100100100 cottidie
constituitur 01 legatur, raca, 01 proprietas, co solo tempore quo uindicatur
(D. vn. 2. l 1.§ ),

(lases in which a iisufruct ‘has the effect 01 0 part’ occur, eg. D. xxx.
lea §§ 2, 3.

si madi uel fructus portio petatur] The chief 01 the inferior 1101.Ι
given by Mommsen has eifractue aelfwadi portio pctctw, and others seem
10 have similar readings. Such 0 reading, comparing the fermus with 0
portic fundi, 10 naturally to be expected aiter the previous sentence, and
might be suggested (without necessity) by the last words of this law ; but
the clause 01 absolutione &c seems clearly suited to a pore fractae as well
00 a porr fiendi. From the words pure 011000 quoe adcreuit it would ap-
pear that the portio here is the whole of the thing at the time 01 the action,
hut a portion only 01 what it subsequently became.
