the ease in our text as an example 01 such an establishment 01 0 usufruct

010110. But unless we suppose Paulus to have altered his opinion, Paulus
could not have so regarded it. Ι think the following view is in better

harmony with the circumstances. The surrender in court takes effect at
once. The usufruct is actually established in the person 011110 surrenderee
with the consequence that 1111111 perish 11110 die or suffer capotii deminutio,

surrenderee cannot actually exercise his newly acquired right. At first
sight it seems strange to imagine 11101 0 surrender would take place in
these circumstances. Buta surrender was the only legal form attha time
for 1110 purpose and it did not require delivery to perfect it. It may well
