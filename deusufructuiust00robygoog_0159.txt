144 Difficulties in creating servitudes 119. pr.

ὥσπερ ἀγρῷ intrita. So also Bes. and the commentator Oyrillus. The
passage has difficulties (see Hasse, let Mus. 1. p. 873 Elvers, 1100110101,
p. 704). (1) How can a 00101100 be said to be imposed when it is created
only 101 110 (10101100 010 usufruct, and on property which belongs to the
owner 01110 dominant tenement also, for 00111· res 000 saort (D. vna 2.

urban servitude at all, but merely establishee a 00011001 10 1001 so longas
the house ie not built'higher. (3) What is the good of such a servitude,
when the fructuary even without it cannot build higher without the con·
sent 01 110 owner: above, l 13. 1 71 Haase takes memfructum 00 meaning
ownership, which is quite impossible. Elvers takes imponere 001011010οι es
001 used in the strict sense, but only as practical arrangements 101 00010
purpose, and suggests thet such a stipulation would have given the heir
a ready means by a penal clause of enforcing the servitude in favour of his
own house, and one which would apply even 1110 sold the reversion 01 110
servient house. It 000010 10 100 1101 we shall best understand Pomponius’
point 01 view hy taking this passage in connexion with the extract (from
the 8th book 01 110 same work of Pomponius) which is D. vm. 4. l 8. Si
oum 01000 haberem 1000100, duobus eodem 0001110010 traditis, 0110011010 est
0010110100 alterutris imposita 001001, qaia alienis quidem aedibus 00
imponi 000 adquiri 10101100 potest. Sed 0010 traditionem pacatam 0011 t
100011 adquirit ael importet is qui tradit, 11100000 calebit seraitae. In both l
passages the question is how to establish a servitude on one lodging-house
in favour 01 another: and the answer in the passage just quoted is that
you must not deliver them 01 110 same time, but on the delivery 01110
1110101001 reserve a servitude for 110 000 still retained, or impose it on
that in favour 01 110 000 delivered. So only can you avoid the double
difficulty 01 0 servitude being imposed 00 000 01 your own houses in
favour 01 another of your own houses; and of your having 00 right ol
imposing a servitude on what has actually become another’s house (1).
v111.4.13; 16. pn). The question occurs, how does this stand 00 regards ’
legaoies by vindication whereby the legatees 010 01 once owners 01 110
estates direotly the inheritance is entered 00 (Gai. 11. 195)t The answer
10 1110 would I suppose be 1101 110 legaoies must be taken 00 110 10010101
directed, and the one legates takes therefore his estate together witha
right 01 road, dvc, over the other, and the other legatee takes his estate
subject to allowing such right 01 road in favour of the first-named. Then

“ comes the case of 001 text: how if one estate be left tc the heir, and the
other be granted in usufruct to the legateel Oen a servitude be imposed
on this latter estate, the propriety of which remains tc the heir, in favour of
an estate also left 10 110 10111 ¹ And the answer 10 (00 101 I agree with, ,
Elvers in reference 10 110 two difficulties first named) : strictly speaking l
it cannot, but the testator may practioally acoomplish it by makingacontract
to allow the usufructa condition precedent to the usufruct, or the disallow·
