other items Out of this exchequer were defrayed the expenses ol the
army and nevy, of the military reads, the post and public buildings, and
the supply of corn to the City. It was under the control of a procurator

to the emperor, the aerarium (theoretically) to the people‚ but eventually
the distinction dropped Pliny speaks of it as real (Pomp. 36) ; Tacitus as ol
no consequence (Aa. vr. 2); Dio Cassius (ΜΠ. 22) says he cannot distinguish
them: Jiistinian treats them as identical (Iart. 11. 6. ξ 14) and has doubt
less often substituted fiacarior cometiae in the Digest. 4. The patrimo-
reiam caesara was the private property of the emperor derived from'mines
and other monopolies and from inheritances, but also including the
ravenues cl Egypt (Tac. H. 1. 11), such as in other provinces passed to the
waliam or fircera. This was managed by procuratores and treated as
crown property, passing to the 'imperial successor, not to the private heire.
ὁ. Rea priuata, separated from the patrimonium by Severus, witha separate
procurator appointed to manage it, comprised such property us the emperor
dispcsed of by will. See Marquardt, Stactaoerw. 11. 292 foll.; Mommsen,

which see Sevigny, term. sar. 11. 130 ; Marquardt, Stacteverw. 11. 237).
