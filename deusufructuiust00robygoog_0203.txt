188 Usufruct in the whole property.. 129.

property is allowable. But the former meaning would be better expressed
by enniana ranna as in D. vn. 5. l 13 l 3 ; xxxin. 2. l 32. ξ 2. . The latter
is the truo meaning; first because bona is a'standing expression for aman's
property as a whole (oi. D. 1.. 16. l 493 12083 borwrnrn possem, bonoram
emptor ,· D. xxxvn. 1. l 3. pr. torta aie, at plerrnnqne solenne dobere, ita acci
pianda sard uniuersitotb caiusque recensio); secondly because the following
clause (nisi mandat dodrantis aestimationem) is referable only to the pro-
perty as a whole. Bas. translates πάντων τῶν πραγμάτων ; but Steph. πάσης
αὐτοῦ τῆς odoini ‘all his property'. The expression occurs in Oic. anca’n.
4. ξ l manc et fractam omniurn bonoram sacram Caesenniae legat. Omnium
hortorum is equivalent to uniuersorum bauan( 34. ξ i), aniaerearann rernm
(Ulp. xxIV. ξ 25); totins patrimonii (ib. ξ 32); bonoram(D.xxx111.2.124;
lev; 143; xxxv. 2. l 69). An analogous use is seen in scentes muniano
bonoram (D. xvn. 2. l 1; 13. ξ 1; 152. ᾧ 17 ; ξ 18); uniuersorum bmiornm
(16³. pr.); tctornno tonnano (l 67. ξ 1); uniuersorum fortunarum (l te).
The two menningo are connected. 1f a usufruct is bequeathed in the whole
of a man's property, there must be'a usufruct or something analogous in
each item oi it, i. e. a usufruct omniane reram qnae in ciciraque patrimonio
esec annotaret (D. vn. 5. l ll), omninno qnae in benissent (D. xxxin. 251 1)·,
and due' security must be given by the usufructuary not only ior the
restitution in specie of things not consumable but also for the restitution
in penem ol money and other things consumable. '

'In the content oia aas. fr. omniurn bonoram were included nernina i. e.
debts due to the deceased, especially regular investments (kalendariano);
and debts due from the deceasei were first deducted (D. xxx111. i. l 24. pr. ;
132.§93137;14330f.xv11.2.13;a.16.139.§1;1833andnextnote).

'nisi excedat dodrantis aestimationem] ‘unless the valae of the
usufruct exceed the velue of three-fourths of the testatore property'. Bas.

strangely translates dodrantis τοῦ ὀκταουγκίου (ie. beroia ‘two-thirds'), but
Steph has rightly τοῦ ἐνναουγκίου. For the general provisions oi the ier
Falcidia, which are here alluded to, see note on l 5 (p. 45).

⁴ Stephanus raises the question, how the usufruct could possibly exceed
three-fourths the value of the whole inheritanoe. He answers that the
property may have consisted entirely in slaves 'and animale, which in the
course of time would die or become worthless‚ so that the propriety would
be worth nothing. But it is not necessary to resort to such suppositione
to find a usufruct of the whole inheritance worth more than three-fourths
the fee. In an extract from Macer (D. xxxv. 2. l 68) we have the rules on
which the value of a usufruct was computet, viz. at a certain number oi
years’ purchase of the annual value, the number varying with the age of the
usufructuary at the commencement. The greatest number given is thirty
years, and even if the usufructuary was a municipality, and therefore
entitledto enjoy the usufruct for 100 years (D. xxx111. 2. l 8), still the velue
was reckoned at 30 years' purchase only. Unless therefore the iee vves
reckoned as worth at least 40 years' purchaso, the municipality would have
