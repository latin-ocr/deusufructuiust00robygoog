112. §d Per traditionem accipere. Infans. 87

evanthis torta fide possession by another does not destroy my usufruct, if
the slave from time to time stipulatas forme and uses my property. See
below in this and next 00011011.

per traditionem accipiat] Vat. Fr. 89 has (narnipiune, amistake for)
menapia acupiat. With this substitution of delivery ior mancipation
compare D. xm. 1.110. 1 1 where we have quod serui nostri eu traditrbne
nanciaarretur for quod caui nostri 1110001010 0001111001 ael ac traditione aare·

Ἰ having cease'd to be used, and the distinction 01 res mancipi and res nec
Ι menapi being abolished, common delivery became applicabis to 011 things

without distinction. Tribonian must 011011 have made like changes, 0. g.

It is presumed that the slave's acceptance 01 delivery is either made
expressly on bahali 01 the fructuary or at least 1101 expressly on bahali 01

infante] Varro accordingto Censorinus (de die nat. 14) made five ages,
each, except the last, 01 fifteen years; (1) puer, (2) adulescens, (3) tanain,
(4) senior, (5) aenea, 1110 last including 011 who were upwards 01 sixty years
0111 According 10 Servius (ad Verg. Aen. v. 495) he made five ages,
(1) infantia, (2) pueritia, (3) adulescentia, (4) iuuentae, (5) senecta. Solon,
partly following Hippocrates, made ten ages, each 01 001011 years (Censen
1414). Quintilian speaks 01 001110 persons being opposed 10 giving
children any literary instruction under the age 01 001011, but himself recom-
mends them to be taught as soon as they can speak (en quo loqui pateant),
and takes this latter period as the age 01 three, end infantia 00 the first
seven years (1. 1. 11 15-21). Macrobius speaks 01 tha seventh year as
that qno piane absoluitur iraeyritaa loquendi (Sane. Seno. 1. 6.1 70). Accord-
ing 10 the lawyers an infans was one qnifari nan pateat (D. 111111. l. l 67
(65) 1 3 ; 111. 5. l 30. 1 1) and this is identified with age under seven by D.
