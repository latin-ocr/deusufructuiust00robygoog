his own (Gai. 11.¹ 96): nor could he, while a slave, be heir, and hence could =
not taire part in a suit for partition of an inheritance (ib. ξ( 187-189). In ·
the case of slaves as in that'of others wh'o were not sat 13113, the inheritance
or legacy was at once acquired by their master (Gai. 11. 87; D. 1111, 2. l 79).
By mancipation a usufnrct could only be reserved, and therefore must
aheady implicitly be one's own. If it was to be acquired by mancipation
through 3 31313, 11 could be only by taking a previous act of mancipation in
connexion with it. Thus A, having an estate and desiring to give B the
usufruct of it, mancipates the estate to B's slave on the understanding
that B should thereupon remancipate it to him, reserving the usufruct
(comp. Pliny in 3313 13 1. 7. 1231131333, p. 64). These methods are all
that were available for establishing usufructs in Gaius' time, at least in
Italian land

What persons then were 3331131311 subiecti in Gaius’s 111331 and in
dustinian’sl In two passages Gaius deals carefully with acquisition
through others and in very similar words (11. 86 sq. ; 111. 163 sq. ; cf. D.
1311110). Adqaim'tar autem actis aaa solam per nosmet specs, sed

possessed by us 1333 fide. The last three classes are apparently dis

the above classes. Irrrt nostro 3311133133 13 the text must therefore be
understood either to include these three last classes as being temporarily
subject to our control (31. D. 11311. 4. l 11), or, if this expression excludes
them, the use of it must be due to the fact that inheritance and legacy
were the ordinary modes'in which a usufruct was created and therefore ·
