tion, but differed as tc the mode cf explaining the origin 01 the doctrine.¹
Vangerow (Pand. § 338 n. 2. § 3) explains it es a refined consequence of
the principle seraitae ’0010110111 noa datur (D. xxxin. 2. l 1. pn). Others,
from slightly different points 0111011, derive it 11010 the fact that 011011111ιο
tuary could not transfer his usufruct (see above note 00 l 12. §2 p. 81), and
therefore could not do what was in effect transferring part 01 the rights
belonging to the usufruct; Keller (dicit—Prosaes§ 24 fin.) laying stress cn
the fructuary having no place in a formal surrender in court3 Zachariae
(Z. G. 11. XIV. p. 133) suggesting that a formally established usufruct could
only be impaired by a formal act, not by amere consent (so Noodt 1. cap.
15); but that, after the time when servitudes could be established by agree-
ment, this rule became antiquated‚ and was taken into the Digest by
mistake: Bocking (Pacci. ξ 162 c. =11. p. 224) deducing this rule from the
essential attachment of the usufruct 10 the person 011110 usufructuary.
Similarly Arndts (Paad. § 179 n. 5, followed by Windscheid‚ Pcad. ξ 203
0. 18) says “The in iare cessio of the owner alone could not establish a
servitude: the ia iare cessio of the usufructuary qua nibil 091101 (cf. Gai..
11. 30) could not remove the (101001, any more than his 1010110οΙ 0000001
0011111, and still less was an ia iare cessio by both together conceivable”‚
and adds that it is practically of οο importance, mere agreement being now
ableto establish and put an end to servitudes‚ and, if strict form were
insisted on, all that would be necessary would be 101 the usufructuary 10
0101001101 his usufruct and then after the establishment 01 the desired
servitude receive it back again. The passage of Paulus which formal 16
Arndts regards as unsuitably interpolated. Kuntze (Errare. tc ξ 541,
p. 501) objects (1) that this explanation from the old ia iare cessio only
applies 1011000111000011101011001111110100011101 there were many others,
and (2) that 1111000 not shew any ground which would not equally apply
to innocent servitudes which yet were allowed (l 16). He holds that the
velue 01 the usufruct could not be reduced, for that would imply a partial
alienation which wes'not allowed 10 0 usufructuary: hence only such 001-
111111100 0011111 be created which did not effect the value 01 the usufruct&
these however could be constituted by the proprietor without the 0000001
01 the usufructuary. My own view would rather be expressed thus: there
is no question herc 01 the practical exercise ofa servitude by agreement
between the parties concerned‚ whether it be a positive or negative servi-
tude, whether the 00111111011101)1 as 0 1001101 01 1001 0110110 his neighboura
right of road through his fields or refrains from blocking up his neighbour’s
lights. The question is, cana servitude be legally and permanently im·
posed 00 an estate, subject 10 0 1101111001, by the owner, 01 by owner and
fructuary combined? Now a servitude can only be created in strict law
inpraesenti (D. vm. l. l 4. pr.) The owner cannot do it ia praesedi, for .
he cannot impair the position of the fructuary, The fructuary has a right
10 use and take produce3 but he has οο right of alienating the property Ι
or changing it in permanence. Oonsequently he cannot supply the defert
