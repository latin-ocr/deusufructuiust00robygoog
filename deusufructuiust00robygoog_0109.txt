(Furtum eateorurectatio rei fraudatore tueri faciendi gratia uel aptius rei
rtet aaut aar eius praecitatae D. xnvn. 2. l 1. § 3). An action for
theft might therefore be brought by various persons (eg. a bare owner, a
usufructuary‚ a mortgagee, a borrower of the thing stolen) for the same act
of theft, and the success or compromise of the one did not affert the rights
of the others For any one was entitled to the action who was interested
and had a right to the thing or to its possession or use, or with the consent
of the owner was responsible for its sale keeping(ib.114. esp. ξ 16; 146.
§ 5 ; 1603 186, &a; Gai. 111. 203 sqq.).' Wheretheusufructwasinone and

magis proprietario, dic] Magri implies that Julian had some hesita-
tion in the matter. Probably the doubt was, whether the condiction should
not be held to be in suspense, until the eventual property in the fnrits was
ascertalned.

competere] literally, ‘to aim together’ is used in the historiens of
being (mentally) ‘collected’, eg. Sall. ap. Nou. p. 276 Sic aaa qrrasijormr'· '
