loo-162. Binum parietibus imponere. 231

Hence the limit to the seourity. If he establishes his right, then he is no
longer the mere possessor bound to give security to all claimants, but the
proprietor answerable only to the general law.

This seems to account for the text, which is eonfirmed also by Bas.
Mommsen however wishes to transpose solaque oi-ole iore suo probet to
the end of the extract· I do not see the advantage oi this proposal.
Rudorff also rejects it (Z. a. G. v1. p. 443).

si ipsi usufructuario quaestio moueatur] Similarly qai de ιιαιιι
οιίιο forment ei qaaestionem (D. xxxvn. 14. l 5).

differtur] The Flor. has-offertur, but Bae. llas ὑπερτίθεται ἡ χρῆσις,
which confirma the inferior nse. in giving de'js'ertur, and the sense re-
quires it.

cauere ei debet] Ι have written this sor the us. correi, which evi-,
dently requires change or addition. The change from cauae ei to οαιιανί is
very slight, and debet may have dropt out by confusion with the fol·
lowing de. The subject both of debet and percepturas est will betha
possessor, and percepturas eat is less likely to be understood of the fruo-
tuary if debet leads up to it. Mommsen correcta caueri into οαιιαιιιι ei.

ipse frui parm] so. ansemundus.

may perhaps be due to the originaltext of Neratius, but it is an odd addi-
tion in any case). What is meant by riuum imponere is not clear. It
may refer toa new gutter or channel for carrying off the rain-water from
one’s own or a neighbours house (of. D. v111. 2. l lflumiaum et atillieidio-
rum eandorem impedit ; xv111. 1. 133 flumina stillicidio ali ιιιιιιο eom, ut
ιἰα ειίιι) ; or to arrangements ior a bath (of. D. v111. 2.119; 128). Noodt
1. cap. 12, refers it to arrangements for water to flow down the walls for
ooolness’ sake and compares Manil. IV. 261 andos inducere tectis apesque
οοιιιιοιοίο adaperqere fluctibus astra,· ib. 265 et peregrinantes doeoihoe ιιιι-
pendere ιιίιαο ,· and Sidon Apoll. xm. 207. One would have expected more
explanation, if this had been meant. Oujao. (Obs. 1. 36=tom 1. p. 33 ed.
Prati) conjectures lectorium (cf. l. 44) ior ιαἰιιιιιι.

Impoaere is frequently used of imposing a servitude (e. g. above l 15.
§7; l 19; 127. ᾗ 4), but here it seems to have a physioel propriety es
well (of. 144).

aedificium inchoatum consummare] This is in accordanoe with the
principle laid down in l 12) 7; but is a point which required distinct
decision. ’

held that no usufruot is possible '.
