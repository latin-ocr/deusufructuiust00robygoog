upon several persons by inheritance, but assumed by their own promise,
each-wordd be liable for the whole, unless the contrary were expressed
'(D. xnv. 2.12; 13.§ ).

In the case of non-divisible servitudes each heir is bound for the whole.

(1).0.17.1192; cf. x. 2125. ξ 10; xxxv. 2. 1 8111 ).

si ex communi praedio debeatur] ‘if the usufruct be due from an
estate (i. e. if the usufruct is the usufruct of an estate), held in common by
several persons'.

sociis] ‘part-proprietors '. Sortes is used sometimes in a wider sense,
as here, of persons who hold property in common without any intention
of forming a partncrship in it, e. g. as heirs or legatees or donees in com·
mon: and sometimes in a narrowcr sense of those who intend to hold it
on joint account (Ι). xvn. 2. 1131-37; x. 3. 12). 10 either case the action

. of one does not make the others liable to third parties though they may be

liable to contribution fater ee. If an action be' brought against one to
en'force the usufruct, judgment against him affects only his share of the
property. . ·
. A usufruct may be divided in several ways, either (1) by dividing the
, land into districts according to the ahares (et regionibus eis ati frui (iudea)
permittet); or (2) by letting the land either to one 01 the usufructuariae or
to a third party, and dividing the rent : or (3) if the thing concerned be a
moveable, by arranging for a deposit of it with the usufructuariae in turns
(urentem).

restitutio] destituere, restitutio are constantly used in law languaga‚
not only of restoration to a claimant 01 what he had before, but of giving
up to him what he had a right to have. The fact of his claim being

approved by the law shews that ha is oet 01 what is due to him, and¹
restoration or replacement become therefore suitablc expressions. Resti-
. tuere is uidetur, qai id restituit, qaod 1000000001 aeter ai controuersia ei

p. 129. It is regularly used of an heir or legatae delivering property
under a trust to the intended holder (infr. 1503 Gai. 11. 248 sqq.; D.
xxx111. 2. 129,110,); and 01 restoration 01 rights of minora, absentees, and
others, quasi-legally but unjustly lost-restitutio ia integram (D. 1V. 1-6;
