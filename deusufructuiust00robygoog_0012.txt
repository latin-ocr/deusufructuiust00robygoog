Tuis hook is the second part of the work published in 1884
⁴ and entitled ‘An Introduction to the Study of Justinian’s
‘Digest containing att account of its composition and of the
‘jurists used or referred to therein, together with a full Gom-
‘mentary on one title (de rasusruotu)’.

In compliance with a wish expressed in several quarters, the
two parta, viz. the Introduction properly so called, and the
Commentary on the title de conjonctio, are now issued sepa-
rately. The work can however still be obtained in its complete
form as originally published.

The following remarks are extracted from the original
preface.

‘of Gaius and Justinian to proceed to the Digest. But the
‘Digestis not easy. Neither the arrangement nor the method
‘nor in some respecto the phraseology is the same as that of the
‘Institutas and whatever title is taken up seems to presume
‘a knowledge of a good many other titles, Yet, so far as I
‘am auare, there is no edition of any part of it, at least in
‘modern times, which furnishes help of the same kind as that,
‘which is expected and given in many editions of classical
‘authors The present book is an attempt in some degree to
‘supply this want.

‘One title -fully explained seemed to me more likely to
‘introduce a student to the intelligent study of the Digest than
‘a longer portion less thoroughly treated. Accident determined
