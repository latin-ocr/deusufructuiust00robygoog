posse before prandonis. No doubt it might easily have been lost there,
but the position is awkward between montbar and its dependent genitive.
It would be better placed after ponernonia and probably as easily omitted

Wild animala are not the property of any one, but become by general
law (inre gentiana) the property of the captor whoever he be and wherever
he captures them (D. xn1. 1. ll 1-3). There is no restrictiori on the right
ιο hunt and fish, butte go on private land or interiore with private lakes
is a trespass in a hunter or fisher just as in the case of any one else (D.
xnvn. 10. 1 13, ξ 7 ; and xm. 1. c). Why then should there be any qnes-
tiones the right of the usufructuaryl For this reason, that wild animala
are not properly produce (firmam), and hrurting therefore so far does not
belong to the fructuary more than ιο any one else. lf however land of
which the only produce is the garns is the subject of the usuiruct, the
fructuary is entitled to this produce, whether he hunts it himself or lets
it out and takes the rent instead (D. xxn. 1.l 263 supr. l 9. ξ 5). Our
present passage adds to this that the same principle applies where the
hunting ground is an adjunctio or part of an estate which, or the buik of
which, is otherwise profitable. 'Phe usufructusry by being alone entitled
ta the de saeta possession of the land is alone in a position to hunt without
trespass, and to exclude others from hunting on the land in question. The
use of the land for hunting may be let out to some one, and then the title
to the rent is on the same footing as the title to an ordinary occupatiori
rent, or ιο a royalty-or other payment for cutting stakes (l 59). The inre-
tuary's right to exclude even the owner from hunting woidd be the same

es his right to exclude him from a joint use of a house or any other thing,
