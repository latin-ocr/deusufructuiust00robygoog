’3.’1 7. ξ 7 however understands the expression of felled timber, explaining
τῆς τεμνομένης ὕλης by τῶν ἐργασίμων μεγάλων ξύλον τῶν μετὰ τὸ κοπῆναι
ἀποτιθεμένων ε’ν τῷ ὄρει ὥστε ἀποβαλεῖν τὴν ὖγμόεηεο. And Pliny, Ιὴ). m·
19. ξ 5, speaks of woods producing timber being a source of regular profit,
'Apri constant campet aiacis a'lais qaae materiam et ea· ea reditum, sicut
modicum, ita atatam praestant. But Pliny may mean by matema poles and
stakes. In English law ‘Every tenant for life unless restrained by cove-
‘nant or agreement has the common right of all tonante to cut wood for
‘fuel to bum in the house, for the'making and repairing of all instrumente
‘of husbandry, and for repairing the house and the hedges and fenoes, and
‘also the right to cut underwood and lop pollards in due course. But he is
‘not allowed to out timber ’. Josh Williams, Real Propera, p. 23, ed.

siout nat. tam. caedebat] ie. ‘at such intervals of time and in ¹the
like quantities '. It is not clear whether Trebatius is speaking of the grant
of a usufruct in express terms of a coppice or read-bede, or of the usufruct
ol an estate having such on it besides other farming arrangements. Pro-
bably the doctrine would hold in either case. -Heimbaeh in Weiske’s
Rechts-Lea. x1. p. 8. ξ 6 apparently takes pater familzas in the sense in
which it is used in ξ 2. But it can hardly denote here more than ‘the
‘ former owner ’, though the usufructuary in this case asin others would of
'course have to act in a husbandlike manner. On this use ospater famellae
