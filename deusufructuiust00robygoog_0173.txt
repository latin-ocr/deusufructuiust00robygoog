11.103; D. 1111. 1.1141; Just. 111. 19. § 4. It was however possibleto get ·
over the rule by stipulating‚ not directly in favour of a third person, but 101
a penalty to be paid to yourself 11 tha desired payment or performance in
favour ol the third person was not made (D. xnv. 1. 138. 1 17).

In the case mentioned in our passage the usual intention 01 stipulating
for 01100011 01 another is negatived hythe words doimndi caasa. But the
result is not altered. Whether the person eventually to be benefited by
the matter stipulated 101 be the stipulator or the slave or the huctuary,
the stipulator only can sue. Payment 10 either stipulator orsleve isgood;
but payment 10 the fructuary is not good, 01. D. xuv1.3.19 pr. Payment
to the slave however is in effect payment 10 the fructuary.

is put and expression used in D. xm. 1. 1 43. ξ 2 (000 next note but one).

interim euius sit] For the purpose 01 making a contraet of purchase
and sale, intention 10 transfer the property, and agreement on the thing
and on the price, is sufficient. Each party has then a right 01 action on
the purchase or sale (D. xvm. 1.1 2. § 1; 1 9, 810). But this agreement
has no effect on the ownership 01 the thing. In order that the property
may pass, delivery must be made on the one side either actually or con-
structively (D. 1111. 1. 19. §§ 3-8 ; Ood. 11. 3.] 20), and on the other the
price must be paid, or a pledge or security given, or credit allowed (D.
xvm. 1.119; lea). But 10 whom has the property passed in this casei
The slave ean acquire, either 101 the fructuary or 101 the bare owner. For
the fructuary in the case put, 'only if the money comes from him: 101 the
owner, both if the money come 110111 him, and, though it come 110111 the
fructuary 01 elsewhere, 11 the slave expressly name the owner in making
his bargain, or make the bargain by his hidding (below ξ 3 ; D. xnv, 3139).
Meantime, 11111110 money is paid, according to Julian the ownership of the
thing delivered to the slave 10 in suspense ; and consequently no 0110 could
bringan action, 1111 were lost or stolen or damaged (01. l 12. ξ 5; D. 11111. 1.
143. b 10).

1110 not necessary that the slave should have taken for the payment
the owners or the finotuary’s money in the non-legal sense 01 the term.
The money may have come from the slava's pacidiana, i. 0. from what was
practically recognised as the slave's private property, proeured probably by
gradual savings. And a slave in usufruct might have two peculia, one
derived ultimately from the bare owner, the other from the fructuary‚ and
respectively belonging 10 each. This is supposed in D. xm. l. 143. §2
