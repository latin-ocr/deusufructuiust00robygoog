4. l 3. § 73 0. 1 10. (ll) pr. ; 127; 11. 4. 1 31). The heir was however at
liberty 10 pay the legacy 10 which he chose, and could then protect himself
by taldng an engagement from the favoured claimant 10 take the risk and
eost of a suit from the disappointed one (D. xxx1. 8. 1 3): 100 Arndts

inuicem sibi impedimento erunt] ‘they will stand in one another's

that the word used by Julian was 0011011001 (01. D. 111111. 5. 144 Paul 1001-

reference 10 the following supposition 01 his afterwards parting with
the propriety.

legatum 11011 1111111111] ‘he will not have the separate usufruct which
was bequeathed 10 him ². Itis merged in the propriety so long as he hae
the propriety and it is his turn for having the usufruot, but, on the year
expiring, the usufruct, as it were, revives again in Maevius, and Titius for
that year has only the bare propriety. It would however be more correct
to say that such 1 bequest should be viewed as a series of bequests, each 01
which vesta only at the commencement of the year, so that the merger
affecta the usufruct 101 that year or part of a year only, without being any
bar to the existence of the usufruct in subsequent years. Of. D. xxx111.

on whether he has, by the tirne when his turn comes again, partod with
the ownership or not (01. D. xxxvr. 2. 123).
