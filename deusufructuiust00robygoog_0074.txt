quish the 1100111101 (l 48 ; l 64). The extent 01 the obligation to repair is
defined subsequently in this fragment of Ulpien

Τ1100011011 to compel him is that arising out of the stipulation which
the heir had hythe Praetors edict tho right to impose on the 001111110-
tuary (I). vr1. 9). And the same stipulation was held to bo proper
(debebit 1000 cautio praedare), if the usrdruct was constituted by a (1000110
mortio caure or in any other way. Ι1 11 was left by way 01 111101, the
stipulation was adopted (l 13. pr.; D. 1119. 1 1. § 23 Cod. 111. eale).
The stipulation was accompanied by securitiea Urosructu 109010 de modo
¹ erardi cautio 0 1100100110 rotet interponi, et ideo perinde omero ae morum
oe ri optimae paredamtlias uteretur, Jtdeioeaoribue obora, caetere eyter
(Paul Seu. 111. 6. ξ 27). More precisely, the impert 011110 stipulation
was twofold, (l) er 0001001 ee torti oiri arbitrato, et, cum urmfnrder ad
eum pertinere detinet, recederem qood inde certatim and (2) delum melum
010000 astrorumque erre (D. v11. 9. l l. pa). The first of these two clauses
is given more fully ib. t 3. dooere amem debet uiri boui aderat per-
cepto (=pereeptum) iri uromsruetrorr, boc ert, 000 deteriorem re oaorem
uemfrnetor factorum orareque suasurum quoe ire re erro feceret. lt was
proper 101 heir and legatae to heve evidence taken (io 1001010111 radgero
0111111111. 139. § 1), probably reduced to writing, 01 the state ottho
thing at the· commencement 011110 usufruct, in order to measure any
alleged deterioration The benefit of the stipulation was not exhausted
by action once token on it: it could be eniorced as 011011 as required ,
011 the occurrence 01 any undae use (v11. al 1. ἐξ 4-6). The action being
ee 01001010 was properly one stricti iuria, 10. based on strict right, as
opposed to an action based on equitable consideration 011110 circum·
stances (bone ]101000110); but the content 01 the stipulation, requiring
the measure 10 be applied 01 what a good man thought right, and
including the clause dedolo, gave it in 1001 the character 01 a berto
fide action. The judge is hence an arbiter. (Comp. Savigny Syrteot
vol. V. pp. 492, 617-619.)

unitum] Arbiter according to tho etymology generally accepted
is from ar=ad and betere ‘go'z and hence denotes strictly ‘visitor', ‘wit-
ness' (Plaut. Mil. G. 158 mi ,equidem iem arbitri urbiai tartareae quid
fiat domn 00101111117111101 celandi quoe soeret, 0000100 corariis
arbitrie adiutoribus, litera eut reroir ; Sall. Cot. 20. ξ 1&0.; see 1011.) ; aud
thus came to be used 01 those judges who were conceived as impartial
hystanders. Cicero (Mor. 12. ξ 27) mocks at the jurists 101 not being able
to tell whether indecor arbiter was the proper word (01. Vah Prob.
p. 144 Kriiger te, Praetor, irtdr'oem arbdmmoe portule oti dee); but in
ltere. 001104 gives the general characteristica 010 judicial action before
a judge and an arbiter, the former having cases where 0 definite thing
or amount was claimed and the judge had simply to decide, aye or no,
the latter having cases where an equitable decisiou had to be arrived·
at on consideration 011110 circumstances and 01 the mutual liabilities
