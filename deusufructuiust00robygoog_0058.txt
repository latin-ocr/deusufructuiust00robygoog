14-15. χ Euolat. Usufruct divisible. ' 43

posce caira usumfructum eu die lepori et ιἰι diem constal. Fuchs (Krit. stau.
p. 21) proposes to substitute coartat in the text. suph. also seems to have

καὶ τοῦτο ἐντεῦθεν δείκνυται τε καὶ δηλοῦται, ὅτι, ὥσπερ ἡ δεσπότεω καὶ πούρωο
(pure) καὶ ὑπὸ ἡμέραν δύναται δίδοσθαι, τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον καὶ ὁ ου’σούφρουκτος
δύναται καὶ παύροις καὶ ἀπὸ φανερᾶς ἡμέρας συνίστασθαι (though itis possible
that γνωρίζεται ‘is recognised as separate' may be meant for arctat).
But there is no 'other instance of ιιιιαιεοοιιιιαι ‘it is certain ³, and the
construction after curarat is an accusative with infinitivo (ag. D. 1x. fl. 1 21.
§1;xx1v.3.124.pr.§5;xxv1.5.15;7.19.§8;xn1.3.144.§1)n0t
quod. It would be grammatical‚ but would involve an unusual sense of
exstat, if we translated: ‘itris a striking fact, that it can be given either
immediately or from a future time’. l think the ordinary meaning of
errarat may be given to it here: ‘is to the fore', is to be found, ‘is not
merged aud undiscoverable’; cf. D. xu11. 6. 1 1. ι 12 reundum ιιι, port·

Quid erpo ιι praedia eutero, uel manopera uel peoora uel aliud quod separari
potest? lu'c ulique impetrari poterit separatio, xm. 7. 1 22. § 2 a praedone

The main difficulty' 1n this way of taking the passage lies' m the
insufficiency of the reason appendedbyPaulus (productilia.) But I
· assume that the passage of Paulus has been altered (see next note) and

that we have only part of his reasoning. It would' 1mpr0ve the text if ιιι
el were struck out as a misreading of ιιιιιοιι ’
uel praesens uel ex die dari potest] It can be guen so as ιο take
effect e1t ther immediately οι· from a future day! In the Vatican fragments
(ᾖ 48-50) we have extracts from Paulus’ Manualia, where he says that
, a usufruct from afutura day could be established by bequest (see infr.
l 543 172) but that whether it could be established by surrender in court
or mancipation or adjudication was very doubtful. Probably Tribonian
’ has altered our passage, which naturally would have contained some such
doubts. (So aleo Huschke on Vat. Fr. l. c.)

15. A usulruct is divisible, and this is shewn in five instances. It may
be created in part; may be lost in part; may be reduced by the opera-
tion οι the lex Falcidia, which assigned the heir a fomth part; the obliga-
11οα to grant it devolvas upon the heirs of the promiser according ιο
their respective shores in the promisere inheritanca ; and a part-owner ,
of an estate is liable ιο the usufructuary only in proportion to his share '¹
ruthe estate. cf. Ouac ad loc. (ιι. p. 760).
