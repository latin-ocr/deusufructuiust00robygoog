168 Why is usufruct lost by cap. dem? 125. ἐξ 2, 3.

Mandry refers it 10 tha principle that cap. dem put an end to all such
claims and obligations, which could not have been established in that
person in the position now assumed by him (Famiiimyiterrecit, 1. p.
172 sqq.). Oohn regards it as an effect of the non-transierability of a
usuhuct or use from one person to another (Beitr. 11. p. 275). In truth a
usufruct was originallya special favour or provision for a particular
person: it was not a mere pieoe of property or marketablc right, which
xwasgiven to a person, to be retained or disposed of as he chose. And a
‘head-breaking' was even in its less important degrees a change of the
economical and social position ofa person. Whether adopted or emanci-
pated, whether a wife under her husbaud's power or a woman with new
guardians, the person was differently situated‚ and therefore so far at least
a different subject for rights and obligations The loss of agnete rela-
tionship was thus a type of the change of position; and the rule of law,
which sprung from that, received a new justificatior and a continued acqui·
asceam from the practical circumstances attending in most cases a capitis
diminutio.

(s) The connexion oi capitis deminutio with the loss of agnete relation-
ship is shewn by its being treated by Gaius, Ulpian (xa ξ 9), and J rmtinian
(luat. Ι. 16) in connexion with the statutable guardianship of agnates. In
theDigest (IV.5)in accordance with the Edict,it comes among other occasions
which called for the interferenoe of the Praetor in restoring the equitabis
position, aa between plaintiff and defendant, which had been legally lost
owing to duress, fraud, imprudence of minors or other unjustifiable cause.
