lassas-14. ‘Return’ of usufruct. Nudus usus. 41

limited right to grant, comes 10 00 end on the arrival 01 1110 time crevent
· 10 question. Paulus (Seut. 111. 6. ξ 28 sqq.) applies the term amittiturusus-
fructus to Nos. 2-5, and fluitur ususfr. to death and expiration by lapse
01 time.

extingui et 011 propr. reuerti] The two expressions are strictly speak- Α
ing inconsistent. The former is really the most exact. The 1101111001 held
by the usufructuary isaright of enjoymentattached to 1110 001000. 00 1110 ·
death or loss either 01 11001100] 01 01 citizenship, or on failing to use, this
right is extinguished and is nowhere at all. The owner 01 1110 land does
not receive back the 11sufruct,but is no longer hindcred in the exercise of
his full rights as owner hy another having. a right to use and enjoy his
land. So D.xx11i. 3. 1 78.pr. cum 111 fuudo mariti habeus mulier usum·
fluctum dotis causo cum morito dedit, quamuis ub ca ususfructus decesserit,
1110111111 tumea acu usumfructum lubet, sed suo fuudo quusi domiuus utitur,
0001001101 per dotem plutum fundi proprietatem, uou separatum usufructu,
(01. Bbcking Paud. ξ 134, Bd. 11. pp. 10, 11). The return 01 1110 absent
usufruct 10 1110 ownership is however a practical way of putting 1110 matter,
andis frequent, 01. D. vr. 1. l 33; 1011116110.

ξ 3. et constituitur] So 1110 10101101 uss: F and the first hand 01 0
Leipsic us. have 0011011111 ,· Steph. supporta our reading: elersen τρόποις καὶ
συνίσταται καὶ σβέννυται ὁ οὗσόφρουκτος, τοῖς αὐτοῖς καὶ adcor συνίσταταί’
τε καὶ σβέννυται. cf. also Just. 11. 5. pn: and below, l 6. The perfect
comtitit, followed by the present fluitur, does 001 seem suitable. Consistit '
· would be a possible correction. .
, nudus usus] 10. use without produce.. See 7. 1 1 (Gai.) cmcstituitur “

ettam uudus usus, id est, sim frmtu: 01110110101101011 modis coustitm' solet ·

· quobus ct musfrudus; ib. l 14. ξ l ususfructus 011 fructus legetur, 111111

mu esse uou potest, usus siae fructu potest.

The lawyers had 00100 difficulty in defining what the use without the
fructus consisted 01. The result 01 their discussions was that the (bare)
use 01 0 house was held 10 be the right 01 dwelling there with a person’s
family and dependente ε 1110 use 01 0 country estate (fundus) carried besides -

this the right 01 consumption for daily use 01 1110 ordinary products, such ’

as vegetables, fruit, flowers, wood, hay and perhaps also wine and oil; the
use 01 cattle carried only 1110 dung, though some thought a little milk was
included z the use 01 0 slave carried hisservices 101 1110 user and his family.
But in 00 case could 1110 0001010110000, unless 110 resided in it also, grant
011011001110101110 use. And in the case 01 a country estate the use must
001 interfere with the regular operatione 01 1110 1011001. See 111108, andthe
’ abridged account, notin all respects consistent with it, in J 001. 11. 5.
