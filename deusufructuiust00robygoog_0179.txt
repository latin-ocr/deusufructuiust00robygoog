plete representation 11 the deceased by the heir. The heir could bring all
actions which his predecessor could, except for insult and the like (iaica-
arrmctriqao alia amitis inueniatur actio, Gai. 1v. 112) ; and the heir ol an
1111111111 could not bring an action cn the stipulation (ib. 113).
Actione on Ι11111 11 his predecessor (ac maleficiis poenales edati ytrtt

against an heir, nor could an action on the stipulation be brought against
the heir oi a sporuor or Jtdeiamor (ib. 112, 113).

An adoptive father, like a natural father, becomes heir through his
adopted son, but otherwise a transference 11 the position ol heir from tha

completely and effectually divest himself oi it (Gai. 11. 35). Practically
however any heir could put another in his place by a sale of the inherit .
ance for a real or nominal price. Legally he remained heir, but, by .
stipulatione entered into between them, the purchaser was bound to .
guaranty him against the burdens of the inheritance, and the heir was
bound to allow the purchaser all the benefits ofthe inheritanoe (Gelu
2t2; D. xv111. 4. See note above onl 12. ξ 4. p. 90).

a paterfamilias, was to be adopted by another, the procedure was by a bill l
(rogatio) approved by the pentifices and passed by the curiae, who however l
even in Cicerc’s tinia were not really resembled but were represented by 3
thirty lictors (Cic. aaa. 11. 12. § 31). The form ol the bill is given by ¹
