retinemus us. in] We retain the usufruct because we exercise all the
rights which the object admits ol It is not the fruits in an economieal
sense that we have to take: if the land is barren, there are none to take ι
we have only to do no act and resrein from no aot, which aot or which
refraining can reasonably be regarded as an abandonment 01 our right

qun ratione retinetur, dte] The usufruct in a runaway slnve isretained
on the like principle to that on whioh the possession 01 the same is retained
by the owner. This principle is, that as possession is retained by the will
to hold as owner, though the immediate physioal control does not exist (1.0.
amineo, though not serpere), an opposing act 01 will by another is required
to divest our possession (D.xn1.2.l3. § 7sqq.; 125. 12). But a slave is

The possession 01 a thing is not compared 10 possession 01 0 00010001
but to the usufruct itself, which was really an effective natural possession
and quite competible with n legal possession by the owner. Permisceri

ξ 4. Julian (as quoted by Ulpian) proceeds 10 discuss whether the
analogy between possession and usufruct holds as regards their extinction.
If adverse possession 01 the slave is gained, the owner loses possession, the
intention by which he holds being deforced by the intention 01 another who

erereise 01 the usufruot is always accompanied by another’s having the
legal possession, and who that other is, matters nothing 10 him so long as
he can exercise his usufruet. Consequently he holds on, though the slave
