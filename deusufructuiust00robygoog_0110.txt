. fortassis 1011101111] Evidently it was not a clear point to Marcellus
that under the circumstances the fructuary had any right 10 the fruits.
He had not plucked them3 they remained the property of tho proprietor‚
although stolen by the 111101 : it was questionable whether now the fructu·
ary had 01 could make any claim 10 1110111 01 all. Hence he says fortassis.
‘It may be, notwithstanding 11111 apparent lapse 0111110 part 01 the fructu-
ary, that if he yet gets hold of them they become 1111’.

efficientur] The Flor. 111. has efficientur: the inferior Mss. efficiantur.
In matters of this kind the language 01 the lawyers is loose: but cer-
tamly no other moed than that 01 efficiantur, which Haloander conjectured,
is tolerable in Latin. Efficerentcr 11 0 possible reading. But 1110 use 01
the present subj. following the imperfect subj. is found sometimes in
classical writers; e. g. 0000111111. 58 0000011011...00010 omnes peterent
Indutiomarum, 0000011 quem 00101 00100001 0000111010 interfectum 01010-
101. In our passage the change may be intentional‚ the point 01 111110 being
taken when the produce has already become the property 01 the proprietor,
and the chance of its being selred by the usufructuary is yet in the future.

ποι-0111000010] Here Ulpian confirma the somewhat hesitating
opinion 01 J ulian 800 above note on 010911 proprietario (p. 94).

oum autem in pendenti est dominium] ‘but whenever the owner·
ship is 111 suspense'. In the case just treated 01, Ulpian, agreeing with
Julian, held that the ownership was not in suspense, but was 1010 time in
111001001101011111111111011110100111 seizcd 1110 fruits, on which occurrence
the property passed 101110 fructuary3 if the fructuary never seized the
lmits, the property would remain with the proprietor. This is a case 01
what is often called by modern writers dominium reuocatile: there is a true
owner 101· 0 time who can bring a suit as such; but since on the property
being divested some intermediate 0011 would be invalidated, such 01010-
cable ownership is easily confused with suspended ownership, in which
111010111010111110 no owner at all. See Vangerow Pana. §§ 95, 96, 3013
