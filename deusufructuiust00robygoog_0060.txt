15. Ι Loss of usufruct by time. Lac Falcidia. 45

for part 01 the ten ysara, the number 01 years 01 absence had 10 be added
10 the ten years; i.e. if a man was domiciled in the same province for
only six* years, the period required would be 10÷(10-6), ie. 14 years·
(Justin Noc. 119. ξ 8). The three years' period prescribed 101 acquiring
the owncraltp of moveables (Ood. vn. 31. § 2) did not apply to the loss
of servitudes; cf. Unterhclzner Vay'dlaraayclelara § 223.

per legem Falcidiam] The lex Falcidia was proposed by Pub. ·

Falcidius trib. pl. 714 auc. (Dion Cass. xnvnn 33). It was intended ,

10 prevent the property· 01 an inheritance being sc given away in legacies
that the heir would be unwilling tc enter. It declared that every Roman
citizen might give what legacies he wi lled and to whom he willed, but with
this provise, that at least a fourth 01 the whole of this inheritance should bo
taken by the heirs under the will (Gai. 11. aa7; D. xxxv, 2. l 1). The
value 01 the estate was taken as it stood at the time of the death. Any
accretions or losses between that time and the time of entry were not
reckoned ; they were an additional benefit 01 burden tc the heir only
(1. 30; 173). If the total amount 01 the legacies excceded in velue
three-fourths 01 the inheritance, all legatees had 10 abate proportionally.
The heir could make the abatement 'on paying the legacy‚ or, if there
was uncertainty whether any, and ii sc what, abatement would be re-
quired, ha could pay the legacies in full, taking security 101 repayment

, 01 the excess (3. 1 1. pr). Anything the heir received otherwise than as

heir was not regarded in computing the fourth. Thus a legacy under

the will to the heir, or anything paid him by a legatee 00 the condition ’

01 his being entitled 10 the legacy‚ or by a slavo as the condition 01
obtaining his freedcm‚ was not rechoned in the 11011’01001111(176; 191).
If there wore several heire, the legacies charged on each heifs share
had to be reduced so as 10 leave him a fourth at least, (not 01 the
inheritance but) 01 his share 01 the inheritanre: and an heir who was
not charged with any legacies did not have his share diminished in con·
sequence oi othe'r heirs being overcharged (177). The value 01 the

inheritancc was usually estimated by an arbiter (3. 1 l. ἓ 6)’; moderate ·

funeral expensas, all debts‚ and the value 01011 slaves manumitted by
the will, were deducted from the value 01 the inheritance before the

. fourth was calculated (1111 19; Iaca. 11. 22. ξ 3). The provisions of

' the lex Falcidia were extended to 'trusts by the Sc. Pegasiannm (Gai. 11.

254), and¹ to trusis on an intestacy by Antoninus Pius (l 18, pr'.>; and Ι

was applied in practice to gifts in view 01 death (0101110 ccccc (1010110000,
xxxix. 6. 127). .

If a usufruct of some property was bequeathed and in consequence
of -thc lex Falcidia an abatement had 10 take place, 0 fourth 01 the
'usufruct was retamed by the heir (Ι). xxxv. 2. l l. 1 9). Βο1 in order 10
ascertain the total value 01 'the legacies a valiation had to be made. A
