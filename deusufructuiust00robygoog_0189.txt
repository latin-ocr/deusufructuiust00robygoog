174 Modes ol establishing a usufruct. 125. ἓ 7.

that it wasa question deserving oi consideration whether the competence
of a fructuary to acquire through the medium oi a slave existed only in
the case of a usufruct erano by legacy‚ seems to imply that bequest
was the original mode in which usuiruots came to be established,
and the same conclusion may be drawn from Gaius' words in 12.
(cf. l 6). '

per traditionem] It is probable that this is one of Tribonion’s
alterations lor per ira iure camimum cet nucupationem (see above on l a pr.
munitm p. 38), though perhaps it is not necessary to suppose it (cf.
Vangerow‚ Pand. 1. p. 757). In the days of the classico] jurists thero
were four ways ol establishing a mufruct by tho civil law : (a) by a legacy
per uindicaturum, (b) by surrender in court, (e) by a reservation on a
mancipation, (ct) by adjudication in a partition suit. Oi these only
surrender in court was availsblc as a voluntory conveyance inter uiuos
for all things whether menapi or uec munbi. And the form of legacy
per uindr‘euttonam was restricted (before Nero, Gai. 11. 197) to things
belonging to the testator in iull civil ownership. Moreover‚ neither were
lands in the provinces capable of surrender in court‚·nor were foreigners
capable of sc creating a servitude or holding it so created Hence two
substitutas came into use.

1. A personal obligation was created in lieu ofa real right. Instead
of the stiff hequest by do lego camo a flexible obligation imposed on the
heir (per domootiomm), or the still more flexible fideicommissum, and
instead oi the formal conveyances by handtake or surrender in court
resort was had to bargains and stipulations (see note pp. 36, 38). Thus
servitudes could be practically constituted between foreigners and
Romans and in provincial landa 'ibe jurisdiction would be at Rome
in the praetor peregrinus, in the provinces it would be in their respective
governors.

2. But this did not properly meet the case ol a neglect of the due
formalities at Rome and in Italy. As with tha transfer of property, so
with the creation of these limited rights, delivery was often used when
mancipation or surrender in court ought to have been used; and these
sometimes even when used were not effectual, because the creator had
a flaw in his title, or the intended acquirer was not legally capable,
or the thing was not one conveyable by exclusively Roman conveyances.
The Praetor however interfered and granted the protection of the court tc
any conveyances made in good saith and for sufficient ground. Hence arose
two classes of servitudes‚ those constituted iure legitimo, and those consti-
tuted per totunm praetor-rt (D. vn. 4.11. pr. Parui refert utrum iure eit
corutdutca monstrosius ata uero tuitione praetoris ,· proinde haoldus quoque
coruscantur, item infundo aoediyalc‘ uel superficie nort iureconsultum, captis
mircctioae amantur (Vat. Fr. 61, which is much mutilated, includes the
case ci provincial lands); 9. l 9. § 1 ; xn111. 18. l 1.§§ 6- 9). Deliveryin
the case of a usuiruct would be either induction into an estate, or actual
