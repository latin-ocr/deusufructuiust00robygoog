prohibitus aut deiectus] The fructuary was not strictly a possessor,
and therefore if he was prohibited from enjoying or was ejected, he had
not a claim to the original interdici de ui. But in virtue of his quasi·
possession a special interdict was granted him (D. 111111. 1613. ξ 13 foll
Vat. Fr. 91). Asimilar extension of the interdict againstausufructuary is
called utile (V at. Fr. 90). The edict however recognised the extension3
it was not due merely to interpretation (cf. Schmidt Immaturae-Versahree,
pp. 20, 213 Vanger. Pand. § 356. anm. 1). The edict used the words ‘aa'
prohibeatur rati fiai usufructu ficadi'. The usufructuary must have been
in occupatiori, and must have been either expelled from the land or
prevented returningto it. Moveable property came under the protection
only as accessory 10 land. Violence done or threatened to the fructuary,
so as to prevent him from using as he chose, founded the right 10 the
interdict (D. l. c. l 11).

omnium rerum simul occupatarum] ‘all things seized by the de·
fendant at the same time ’. The language 01 the edict was ‘dc eo quaeque
ille tuuc ibi tabuit iudicium dubo', and was explained to cover 1101 only
the plaintiff⁷s own property but things deposited with himer lent or
pledged to him, or 01 which he had the usufruct or eustody‚ and which
were on the premises at the time 01 the ejection, even though they
afterwards perished (D. 111111. 16. 11. ξ 6; 33-38). Apparently simul
is equivalent to the tuac ibi of the edict But it may 0110 be taken
with agit, to imply that one action was sufficient to cover the whole
pleint. For occupare used of such unauthorised taking, see D. l. 0. §29 ;

sequence 01 the eviction, the plaintiff has right 10 more than the text
gives: he cau claim against the ejector for the full value of the lost
usufruct (D. 111111. 16. 110). But if it be lost by some other means (alio
cusu) eg. by expiration 01 time, or 1011 01 caput, or by death, the ejected
person or his heirs can claim only for the velue up to the date 01 the loss
(11113. §17; 011 9. ξ 1), which presumably is the same astho percepti
