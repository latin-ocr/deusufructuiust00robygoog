siue ei possessio fuerIt tradita] Delivery of a thing, the pro·
perty 01 which is to be transferred, is putting a person into exclusive
possession 01 it ; and hence delivery 01110 thing is the sameas delivery 01
possession 01 110 thing. Hence tradere possessionem is often used in the
same meaning as traducerem, but especially where there is some collateral
distinction, eg. between the delivery 01 110 mere possession and the
transfer 01110 ownership by the delivery, e. g. D. xm. 2. 138. § l 1101011-
maedam est possessiones 001 condicione tradiposse, sicat res 001 coadunatae
tradantur (01. Savigny, Besite. ξ 19. p. 245. ed. 7) ; or where the person actu·
ally delivering is merely in possession and not the owner (D. 11. 14. 136). I
is even used 01 0 transfer 01110 legal, but not the actual, possession
(D. vr. 1. 177). For instances in general, see D. xv111. 1. l 74 Olaaibra

That (legal) possession could be acquired through 0 slave by the slave’s
owner was beyond doubt (Gai. 11. 895 D. ΧΗ. 2. ll. § 5). Possession
could also be acquired by the apparent owner 01 0 slave, though the slave
was really some one’s 0100, or even nota slave, but 0 freeman, provided
only the apparent owner was acting 1000 fiae. And possession so ac-
quiredindue time ripened into'ownership (Gai. 11. e4; D. ib. § 6). Βο1
· whether in the same way possession could be acquired by a fructuary
through 0 slave, 01 which he had the usufruct, was in Gaius’ time
doubtful. De dle quaeritur, 00. per 0000000010 ia qao usumfructaia
