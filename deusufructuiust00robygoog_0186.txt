125. ἓ 5. Hire by slave of his own services, 171

with the fr'uctuary's property-obviously a legal nullity. At the end
of the section Julian says, that if the slave is expreme acting for the
proprietery, the case is different: it is real business, and the proprietary
acquires Presumably an order from the proprietary would have the
same effect (cf. § 6 ianam pro nomiae occirrimuc). One is inclined ιο ask,
why, if there were no express mention or order of the proprietary,
the rule of Julian laid down in ξ 3 could not apply, the very fact, thet
the business would be invalid if the slave were presumed to be acting for
the fructuary‚ being sufficientto shew that he was acting for the proprietary.
The answer is, I take it, that such a hire of the slave’s services by the
slave was in practice not an unoommon event The fructumy allowed
the slave to make what he could, rescrving ιο himself only a fixed payment
or rent, the remainder being, in other words, allowed to count in the
slave's pecudium. But there was no legally binding obligation, and least
of all did the fructuary mean by such an arrangement to bind himself to
the slave's proprietary, unless the proprietary was expressly named in
the formal contract, or the slave proved an order from the proprietary,¹
cn which if necessary the fructuary could sue the proprietary.

et sl ex re mee, dra] This is a general proposition not confined ιο
the case of a fructuary and a fructuary's slave. A slave buying from me
with my money, or lending me my own money, cannot bind me to any one.
The whole businessisnull .

seruus alienus bona fide mlhl seruiens] The good scithis that
ol the person cni send, not of the slave, and so long as this good feith
continues, the slave acquires for his possessor on the same conditione only
as a fructuary’s slave, i. e. cc rc possessorio auf cc operte cad. And the same
applied where the person bonafide semim was really afree man (Gai. 11.
92; 111. 1643 D. xm. 1. 123 pr. and§ ).

Such an occurrence as my having the services of anothers slave,
believing him to be my own, may arise as with any other chattcl, e. g.
an heir may have found him on the testator’s estate, hired out or
deposited with the testator, and may have sold him to me under the
belief that he was part of the inheritance (Gai. 1L 50; D. xn1. 3.136),
or he may have delivered him to me in fulfilment of a legacy (cf. D. xn1. 8.
15; 16); &c

idem agendo] ‘by doing the same', i. e. sufflando α oce rem mam.
If he gained for any one it would be for his real owner. He cannot gain
for me, whom he is actually sarving, my own thing, and the same applies
to the contreot of letting and hiring. Why in suche case he does not gain
for his owner may be explained as above in the case of a slave in usufruct
(The statement in D. xm. 1. 123. ξ 2, though confirmed, as Mommsen
points out, by the Greeks and better expressed by them, seems to me im-
perfect and wrong in substance, and not in languege such as Ulpian would
have used No slight emendation will put it right.)
