separately’. The position of a usufructuary in comparison with the

· owner's position is peculiis, and naturally gave rise tc different modes

' of expression according to the circumstances, A usufructuary had the
exclusive possession (physically) of the thing and the exclusive right to
take and consume its produce. These were rights of ownership exerciseable
by him or his nominees, and the owner could no longer exorciso them.
Hence the grant of a usufruct might be considered us the severance from
the ownership of those rights, and thus we get such expressions as dedrrcto
usufructu proprietas tegeri potest (cf, l 6. ξ 2, dc), and ususfructus umbus
ud proprietatem recurrit (Paul. Scut. 111. 6. ξ 28). In some lights therefore
a usufruct (a) may be called a part of the ownership (as here and cf.
D. xxxr. lto. ξ 2 (Papiu.) frutetus portionis instar optimu: and (b) in
some matters is treated as such ; eg. a bargain not to sue for an estate was
a good pl'ea to an action on the same title for the usufruct (D. 11. 14. l 27.
ᾗ 8) ; a stipulation for an estate included the usufruct of the estate (uiuitis
., est ci qui totum, deiude purtem stipulatur, xcv. l. 158); one bound.to
make over an estate could give a surety bound only for the usufruct
(xnvr. l. l 70. ξ 2); abequest of an estate could be diminished by the
usufruct being withdrawn (xxxrrr. 4. l 2. t 1); in all which cases the analogy

of a part, not of a servitude, is followed ; and (c) the usufructuary was some· · ¹

times included under the term domiuus(xn11.5.18.pr.). On the other
hand a usufructuary was in other respects very different from an owner: ’
he had not the legal possession3 he had no power of consuming the
substance, nor of creating servitudes, nor of alienating his right, nor even
of transmitting it to his heir. The owner had all these rights, as well as

those exerciseable by the fructuary, inherent in his ownership, and only Ι

partially and temporarily dormant in consequence of the grant made to a
stranger of· the use and produce. And therefore in many respecta usu·
fruct was not part of the ownership. Thus (a) l 33 (Papin.) usumfructum iu
¹ quibusdum casibus uon partie effectum optinere eureseim xxxr. 166. § 6
(Papin.) uuunder ira iure, uou iu purte, consistit ; n. 16. 125. pr. (Paul.)
recte dicimus eum fundetur totum pertransactae curu ususfructus uiduus
eet, quio ususfructus uon dominii pars sed seruitus (seruitutis F.) sit, ut uic
et iter ; persalse olibi totum meum esse, cuius nou potest ullu pure dici ulterius
esse,· and (b) aformal release of the usufruct by one to whom the estate
itself was due was invalid, because the usufruct was not a part (D. xnvr. 4.
Ἰ l 13. ξ 2) ; and (c) the usufructuary was constantly opposed to the domiuus,
and sometimes expressly excluded from the name (xxrx. 5. l 1. ᾗ 23 xtvrr.
2. l 43. ξ 12). Gaius states and does not decide the question whether
ususfructus pars rei sit au proprioru quiddam (D. xnvr. 1.170. ξ 2). See
