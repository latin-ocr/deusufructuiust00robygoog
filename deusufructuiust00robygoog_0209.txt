' 01 course wholly responsible in the actio 1111110110 (111. 3), 01 actio 111101-
1011111111. 1). But where the slave was concerned for himself, the action
was in form against the master dc peractio (xv. 1), 01 11 the matter related
10 some special trade 01 the slave’s, it was 110110 tentatoria (1111. 4). 011
the death of the 11111 the perediam fell back 11 11 were into the masters
property, unless he allowed it to go 10 tho slave's relatives or assignees.
On his being set free or alienated, the peculium remained with the master,

unless expresely stated to accompany the slave (D. 11111. 1.129; 1111.
138. pr.; 111. 1.16). The right of action however remained with the

creditore 101 1 year (D. 11. a] 1). if a 11111 was in usufruct‚ he might
have a psaltim belonging legally 10 the proprietary and another be-
longingtcthefructuary(12); but the creditore were not bound by thie
distinction, and 11 the one perediam was not sufficient, they mrild come
upon the other (11.1.119; lea. pr. ; 137. 13). The proprietary and
fructuary could enforce their claime on the slave, each against the other (ib).

(c) The slave was not justified in squandering the 1111111111, and
therefore was held not competent 10 do eo; 111 could not make presente,
even though he had expressly (cf. 17. 1 1) free management'allowed him
(D. 1111111, 5.17; of. 111. 6. 1 3. 1 2). Itis indeed doubtful whether
and how 111 libere administratae peculii really gave 1111111 powers than
11101101 ordinary prudent management (Mandry chsiienpztterrcctt 11.
pp. loa-106). But management would include power 01 alienation in
the ordinary way 01 business, and such alienation would be valid (D. xv. 1.
148;11.1.141.1).

hesds named in our text. 1. sire by the master (in our case represented
by tho fructuary). The gift must be executed in the usual way by
delivery 01 definite separation 01 the thing given (D. 11. 1. l 8). In the ·
casa of a slave 111 usuiruot 01 the property 01 more than one owner, the
gift may bc made with either of two intentione, ’1.1. either that it should
form part 01 the slava'e perediam belonging to 1111 giver‚ or that it should
pass either 10 the fructuary, or to the proprietor 01 (partly) to the copro-
prietor (above 122; 111. 1. 1 311 ). 2. The slave may have received the
thing from elsewhere-a gift, or legacy, or inheritance, 01 proiit on 00111-
mercial transactione, 01 hire 101 his services, 110. Legelly this becomes at
once the property of his master (or under circumstances 01 the fructuary,
1111111111 master may allow him 10 retain it 11 part oi his pamelium,

something out of his masters payments to him for clothing, or food, or
lodging, 110. (11. xv. l. l 39 ; Seneca, Ep. 80. 1 4 perediam 1111111011 com-
parocemnt uentre fraudato, pro capite 1111111001). From whatever source
it was acquired, the peculiam was often applied to purchase the slave’s
liberty. hegally, of course thie only meant that tho master (or hie heir)
