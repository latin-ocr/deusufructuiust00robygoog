196 Orestion 01 servitudes ad tempus, and 00 tempore. 132.

inhabitare] A right of residence differetl little as regards its 00010010
from 0000 domis (effecta 11οη paene eet D. vn. 8.110.pr.). Presumably
therefore the person entitled could reside with his relations aad dependente,
could receive guests, could even 101 part if he continued to reside there
himself. He could not give (donare) the right 10 others. lf nothing was
said, the right was for life. It did not however pass to the heir, nor 00
110 other hand was it lost by non-use or by eapitis deminutio (ib. also § ).
Reservaticn of right of residence for the vendor or others on 001001 0 house
is mentioned in D.x1x.1.113.§30; 121. ξ 6; 153. § 2.

perciperetur] This ought 10 10 percipiatur. In a mountain pastura
(001100) 110 principal produce (fumus) would( be grass, and would be
gathered (percipiatur) by the sheep or cattle turned in 10 feed.

temporali] The inferior 000. have temperata which Mommsen approves,
though Stephanus supporta the Florentino reading. As a word beginning
with e follows temporali the proposed change is very easy, and properly nc
doubt the restriction cf time affecte 1101110110 001 acceptio. But a reserva-
1100 01 0 temporary right of residence might so readily be spoken of as a
temporary reservation that I see 00 necessity for deserting the Florentine
reading. Of course this temp. eaceptio has nothing to do with the use 01
110 words for a ‘dilatory plea’, e. g. D. 0010. 1.la; n'. 16. l 55. Temperat
1001010110, ‘a right 01 residence for a time’, 10 00 expression 001 found else-
where. The ordinary phrase would be habitatio 001 tempas.

There were two or rather four questions discussed relating 10 temporary
restrictione on servitudes: whether they could be established ad ternpus
and 00 ternpore, i. e. to last till a fired day, and to commence from afixed day,
001 110 present moment; and again whether with such restrictione they
could be reserved as well as directly constituted It was agreed that they
could be bequeathed (per 01001001100000110110010000000010010000000
further that inter aiace they could be constituted ed tempas, and Paulus
thought they could be reserved ad tempas, but that they could not be con-
stituted, and he doubted whether they could be reserved ea ternpore. Pom·
ponius thought they could 001 10 reserved ad tempere (Vat. Fr. 4a-50).
Sabinus held that in striot law 0000 01 11000 were possible, but that by
agreement (0001000) they could practically be done. And this opinion
reported by Papinian, is adopted 10110 Digest (vm. l. 14. pn), and
becomes more important in consequence 01 J ustinian's allowing agreement
10 10 0 legitimate and effectual way 01 establishing a servitude. See note
0013 (p. 38). The precise mode of reconciling Pomponius’ view 00 reported
by Paulus in the Vat. Fr. with our own passage from Pomponius is not
clear. Tribonian has probably altered our passage.

133 pr. When a man bequeaths the propriety and the usufruct he
bequeaths the whole 01 110 thing, and the heir has nothing in it. If the
intended fructuary die before the inheritance is entered cn, the bequest of
the usufruct 10110, and the legatae of the propriety becomes effectual owner.
lf the legates of the usufruct had died after the legacy 000 vested, the case
