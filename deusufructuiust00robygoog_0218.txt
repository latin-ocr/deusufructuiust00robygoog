134. pr. Consequences of mergar. ’ 203

quia] This by way of proof introduces another caso, in which a merger
is averted bytho baro ownership being parted with before the usufruct
becomes vested.

si sub condicione dra] A legacy whether of a usufruct or anything else
made on condition does not vest till the condition is realired (D. xxxva 2.

l 5. ξ 2). When this occurs, then the capacity of the legatae to take eomes
in question and not till then (ib. l 5. ξ 7 ; l l4. ξ 3). Consequently
the fact, that while the condition was still in suspense the legates held for
a time the bare ownership, does not affeot the legacy. If he had continued
tc hold it, the usufruct would on the condition being fulfilled come to him ψ
indeed, but then be at once merged in the ownership, and thereby be ‘
extinguished absolutely, so that if in any way he lost the ownership
he would not retain the usufruct. This is illustrated by D. vn.
4. l 17. There a man (Maevius) has the usufruot bequeathed to
' him absolutely, while the bare ownership is boqueathed to Titius on
condition. Maevius acquires the ownership (subject of course necessarily
to the condition) from the heir and by this act merges the usufruct in it.
The condition is fulfillrd Titius becomes proprietor, and, as the usufruct
no longer exists separately, becomes proprietor with full rights. Similarly
D. xu. 4. 16. The owner of a slave makes his will, appointing the man
¹vvho has the usufruct of the slave his heir, but giving freedom to the slave
on a certain condition. The fructuary becomes heir: his usufruot is there·
fore merged in the ownership: the condition takes effect, and the slave
thereby gains his freedom at once. So D. xxx1. l 76. ξ 2. Again v11. 4. l 27.
A slave commits some offenoe against the man, in whose usufruot he is,
which gives the fructuarya claim against the owner. The owner surrenders
him norae to the fructuary. The usufruct is merged, and henceforth gone.
Consequently (if Inst. 1v. 8. ξ 3 apply, see p. 136 o) the slave by working off
the amount of the damage becomes free. Whether liberabitur in this l 27
be taken of the slave being no longer subject to the fructuary quc fructuary,
as Bas. (φθείρεται ἡ χρῆσις) and Pothier take it (and this seems best), or of
the usufructuary being freed from all obligation to the (former) owner, as
Gltick(1x. p. 35511. 82) and the German translators take it, or of the
eventual freedom of the slave (on which see note on117.§2oorae§o.
p. 136), does not make any difference for our point. Of course mergar
affectsonly the particular usufruct or servitude in question τ any owner in
full rights can create such a usufruct or servitude afresh. For cases
in which mergar is revoked see below l 57.

ad lentum admittar] ‘I shall when the condition is fulfilled be
admitted to the usufruct', and consequently have to give the usual usufruc-
tuary's stipulation. Admittere is frequent in such cases where the inter-
position of the praetor is usual, ag. D. xxxv, l. 126. pr. quamuis uerbis
edicti ad hereditatem uel legatam admittatur ; v. 2. l 6. ξ 1 siquis eritis
peremtis qaae ad successionem ab intestato reon admittentem xxxvfl. 6. l 1.
§8; xxxix. 2113. i 3.
