sed ego puto, dc] There were two principa] questions in such lega
0100. (1) What is included under fundet (or under demedi (2) What 10
included under instrumentum fundi (or instrumentum domnail It was
common 10 specify in a will fundum &c cnm imtrnnnnto, or sendum duc. et
instrumentum, and these were two legacies‚ the funden &a being one, the
instrumentum being another. Further suendae 110100001οε was held to
include rather more than these (D. xxxr11.7.112.§27 sqq. but cf. 15).
In the cese of 0 bequeet 01 0 00011001 Ulpian holds that the imtvnmemnm
10 included under the mere word fundes or domna This was doubtless
because the estates or house cculd not well be used ner the produce taken
without the imtrnmentem. 11 was otherwise in the case of the bequest 01
(11ιο property in) a house or estate. There fundae or domm did not carry
with it the instrumentum (D. xxxin. 10. 1 14), except 00 far as permanent

Possibly it was on this analogy that some denied the fructuary the right 01
using the barrels andjam, &c On a sale 01 an estate, reserving the
fructae, it was held that the 010110 passed 1ο tha purchaser (D. xv111.
1. 140. 1 ).

nisi detonuerit uoluntas] ‘unless the intention be opposed 10 it',
i. e. the intention 01 the testator in this case, in other modes 01 constituting
a usufruct the intention of the contracting parties. For 00100100 cf.

which the usufruct is in another, nor can he lose an existing servitude.
Both acts would deteriorate the position 01 the usufructuery. But he cau
