¹ Gaius dces not speak of this theory as more than a lawyers interpretation

of the facts (11011010 111ὶί101111, cf. Gsi.11.89); and in ite application to the ⁸

· question of land becoming retiqiosaa, implies that som'e (for he says only
1111160110) drew no distinction between Italian and provincial land As

this theory gave ownership to the State, the provinciale could have only Ι

some inferior right, which he calls loosely &possession or usufruct'. That
Gaius did not regsrd it as technicallya usufruct is clear from his saying
that provincial lande passed by delivery, and that usufructs did not. In
truth he uses ‘possession or usufruct' simply to denote the defucto position
01 en owner, which yet theory prevented him from calling ownership. Such
a da facto position Frontinus also attributes to provincial lends. They
, were not capable 01 strict mancipation, or oi usucapion: but they could
bepcssessed, could be sold, and could be vindicated : only they had tc pay
taxes or ground-rent, end that did not accord with the Roman conception
of an owner. Ownership therefore in this case lay with the sovereign whe
took taxes cr ground-rent from the provinciale by the same principle theta
leesor 'takes rent from a lessee. So the tenure of the provinciale must be
reduced to possession or usufruct conditional on their paying taxes.- Now it
is curicus thet these same expressions (‘poseession'‚ ‘usufruct’) are demon-
strably' used of owners in the provinces who were not subject to taxes.
