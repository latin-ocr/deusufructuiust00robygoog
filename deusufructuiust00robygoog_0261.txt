old or useless animals, ‘on the substitution of others for them, become the
property ol the fructuary’. The exact reference of quoque is not quite
clear. It might be taken to refer to the second and comesponding case of
sudden change oi ownership without delivery. But it is possible also ιο
connect it with ec natura sruuur. It was as froits that the young animala
became the property of the usufructuary: und under the same character
of iruits the old animala, now as it were pushed off by the younger, cesse
ιο ιο ιιο proprietors and become the fructuary’s.

ι uam urorum] For in other cases we find things, when first born,
hemming the property of the fructuary, and afterwards when substituted
sor other produce, ceesing to be hia The reference is apparently to the
case of trees mentioned above inl 18. The act ol gathering or appro-
priating by virtue ol the position of the fructuary, requires no act of
delivery by the proprietor; and the substitution ol the new plante or
young animale for the old ones is an aet of delivery on the part of the
fructuary. Δ

’ 170. pr. sluon faciat uso suppleat] Kriiger and Mommsen suggest
the omission of uec suppleat. But the words may be retained if we con·
aidersoeiot equivalent to mmmmm and thus representing an earlier stage
in tha proceeding to that expressed by suppleat. But as Ulpian's sentence
at the end of l. 68 is broken off, we cannot tell what may have intervened
in Ulpian between l. 68 and l. 70.

teneri] ‘that he is liable² in an action on the case. Godefroi compares
the somewhat analogous cases given in D. xus 5. l 10 ; l 12.

ξ 1. quamdiu summittantur] ‘whilst the youngarebeing let grew and
the heads which have died are being replaced'. Quamdiu sometimes
means ‘until' (cf. D. v11. 4. l 15), and that meaning would suit with supple·
untur. The omission of the subject to remmittuntur is awkward Per-
haps the impersonnl auutmittatur was the real reading. Supplere was
'used above in l 68 in the sense of ‘fill up ’, and so probably et the beginning
of this law. Here by an easy transition it means ‘replace’. The question
raised is this Some members of the herd die: there is at the time no
young animal old enough to put into the herd, but there are some young
which, some or all, may in time be fit, but may also die previously or be
killed or sold Whose property are these youngl The answer is, till they
have grown up and are placed in the hard, they belong whether alive or
dead (1693 17.'§ 2) to the fructuary, and are at his risle If and when
they are so placed, they belong to the herd-owner. J uh'en however treats
this es a case ol property in suspense, and, if this be so, the property is
not deeided until some act on the fructuary's part, e. g. sending the lamb
vto the butoher, or putting it in the herd, fixes the animel’s lot. Meantime
it the animal is stolen, neither huctuary nor owner can bring a condictio
furtiuo(112÷§ 5), and, if the animal is slain and caten, is the thies to be
always unpunished because the decisivo eet cannot now be taleni If the
mufruct come to an end, while there are still young animala in this proba·
