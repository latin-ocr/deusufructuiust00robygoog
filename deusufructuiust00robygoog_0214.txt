decem iugera allectione maceriae, the purchases has them. In this last
case the word adcrescere is used literally, and the cese hes not the
characteristics of the others. In principle it falls under the class of
accessione rather then under that of accruals. It serves just below to
points contrast.

A vrsufinct is the subject of acerual in two cases (y) from the usu·
fructuary to the proprietery and (Ιι) from one usufructuery to another.
It accrues to the proprietary when there isno usufmctucry entitlod, end
then follows the ownership just as accretions from water follow the

It aceruos to another usufructuary when the intention of the testator was
not to give them definite shares or specific parts of the thing but to make
them joint usufructuariae, ench being entitled to the whole. Then the
rights of each being only limited by the concurrent rights of the other, on
the one dropping, the survivor‚ no longer impeded, can exorciso his rights
over the whole. Whether the usufruct be legerem cantanetiae or disiunctae
they must, in order to have the right of acoruel, be entitled not to a
part of the usufruct but to the whole. Totiace iae adcrescendc' ert, quotieas

It will have been seen that in the four first-mentioned cases the
property is not vested before the accrual. When it is vested, the property
held in common cen be divided by a pal-bition suit, and whether divided or
not the shares pass to the respective heire. T he four letter cases are
different both from the former and from one another. In the fifth case
(e) the act of the manumitter is treated as an abandonment of his rights:
in the sixth (f) nature makes the addition to the property irrespective of
who may be the owner. In the last two cases the right of usufruct is
concerned, and that is personal and never pessos to the fructuary's heir.

iudicatae rei exceptionem] (a) A defeated pleintiff cannot be allowed
to bring his action over and over again3 nor a defendant to bring an
action on the seme matter against the successful plaintiff. When an
appeal is allowed, the jndgment in the suit cannot be considered given
until the appeal is finally settled. After that the matter is res indecere.
According to the lew under the formulary system, in most actions the

praetor allowed a defendant, in a suit on a matter which was already
decided, to plead that it was res icddate, end this plea, if established, was
fatal to the plaintiff's proceeding. There was one class of actions in which
the pleintiff was stopped sooner: he was not allowed a formula at all.

This class of actions consisted ol those which were tried before a single
judge (not rcaeperatcres) in the city of Rome between Roman citizens on a
