‘what I discussed with you’, or ‘proposed ιο you’; tamem oraui ‘spoke
with you' ιο. asked you; quod agor aeacum ac iare ciuili ac praetorto
aroc taber (Oic. Goaria 12. ι 34); ‘you have nothing to do with me (ie.
‘nc ground for an action') either from the civil or praetorian law’. So
frequently cum quo agitur for the ‘defendant’, opposed to qui agit for
the ‘plaintiff'. Our present phrase is found in Gai. 1v. 1633 D. 111„ 5. l· 32

of ‘sue’ is convertible with agere.
120. fructus annuos] The same decision, referred backtoLabe0,is
given by lavolenus D, xxx111. 2. 141. The ‘annual' produce is taken ιο
be equivalent to leaving a person the ῥοοιοι, and the fithar was held to
bsequivalenttothecsaafiuetua(D.VI1.8.l14. § 13 Paul. Seru. 111 6.124
Ferrato legato si arar aaa adscribatur, magia placuit usumfructum uideri
ademptam: saraam araim sirac aru erac aaa possam). Hence the legatae
would have the use of the estate as well, and would have the αοιίο consea-
aoric and interdicte ιο protect him. On the other hand he would be
entitled ιο ιιο fruits only cn gethering them, and the right would cease on
his suffering rapitr's <laniantia and on his death A similar hut somewhat
more beneficial legaoy was a grant of the produce year by year (ia rimulas
aanor l 25. § 2). Such a legaoy, whether os the produce of a particular
estate or ofa sum of money (an annuity), or anything else, ive angulos
anaor, ‘for esch year ’, was regarded asa series of legacies, each of which
became due at the commencement of the year, the first vesting like any
. other legacy on the death οι the testator and not being deferred till the
heir'sentryontheinheritence(D. xxxva 2. 112. §3; cl. vm 3). In case .
of death of the legates, this legacy, like that ota usufruct, cameto an end,
but the legatee’s heir was entitled ιο the payment of the annuity for that
year, isit had not been already received by the legatae (Ι). xxx111. 1. 14;
ls; xxxv1.2.l 12). A usufruct ia singulos anrwr was destroyed also by
capitis minutio, but only so far as that single year was concerned: with ’
ιιο next year commenced a new logaoy unaffected by the capas deminutio
(D.v11.411;12.§1;13.pr.;1v.e.110). Ofcourseifthecapita'rdemi-
catio was mamm, ιο. involved the loss of freedom, the legates would,
unless restored ιο his former position, be incapable οι holding ιι agaim if
meua, ie. involved the loss not of freedom but of citizenship, the answer ,
would be the same: for the usufruct would be regarded as a newly coming l
legaoy and a non-citizen was incapable oi taking such (Gai L 24, 25;
Paul. Seru. 1114 οξ 9; xnvm.13.l 33 22. l 15; l 6). How the matter
would stand, if the testament were mede by a provincial in favour of pro-
vincials, is another question. ¹
