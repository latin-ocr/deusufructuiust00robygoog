· ramos ex arbore] ‘boughs from trees growing in the eoppioe’. 'l'he ,
pedumeruu would usually be stems growing from the roots or stumps: if
there was a large tree, he might eut branohes, but to fell the trees theme
selves was not allowed him.

in niueam sumpturum] In a ooppioe the usufructuary may cut for
any purpose, even to sell; in a wood not intended for lopping (e. g. sil
¹qloeudau'u, see Cato quoted in note on silua 0000100) he might out what
was required for the vineyard, but only if he could do so without spoiling
the estate.v A similer restrictiori was necessary even in a ooppioe, if the
right was only a rural servitude, not a usufruct (D. vm. 3. l 6. ξ ).

1 11. si grandes arbores essent] 1 understand this to relate to large
trees whether in a adero caeduo or a silue uuuoueduu. A qualification
‘except for the purpose of repairing the isrmhouse’ is added in 1 12. pr.

l 7. ξ 2. It is diffiosdt to see why ui 00010000 is not applicable to euolse's
as well as to 01000110. The aetion of water is the only involuntary agent
besides wind that is likely to have upset e tree. Perhaps the explanation
is this. Trees could fall either by the roots being pulled up or the stem
being broken. Wind or human action is the most common agent in either
ease. Ulpian was going to spesk quite generally (euolsis uel deieuu), but
remembering the use 01 01010000 01 men falling trees he has inserted
ui suetorum before 01010010. Euellere is also 'spoken of men’s aetion as
in D. xnvn. quoted above, but rnen would not pull up timber trees unless
when very young and unimportant. For 010100νο01.113.14; ξ 53 lle.
