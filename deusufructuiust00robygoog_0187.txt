§a ei duos fr. proponas] ie. Put tha case of two persons (A
’ and B) jointly having the usufruot oi a slave, who by uss of the property
of one of thern, say A, eontracta with 0. Does A get the whole benefit'
of the contracti or does it come to A andB, andis so,inwhatsharesl
or does it, or any of it, enure to the benefit of the owner of the slavel
Scaevola had, it appears, discussed the same question, only assuming
two boae fide possessors instead of two bustuarias, and said that it
was the common belief (among lawyers) and supported by the logic
of the case that A gets a share (proportioned to his share of the
usufruot), but that tha other share does not ran to A nor B, but to
the owner. Olearly the reasoning is this : A is not entitled to it, because
he is a stranger as regards the second 'share in the slave, Bdoes not get it,
because as bono Jtde possessor he can acquire through a slave only so far
as hs has contributed either some property or the slave’s services.
And in this case the acquisition being due to the use oi A's pro·
perty only, B has no claim, and the excess oi the acquisition over A’s
share will fall to the owner (cf. supr. § 3). If the slave had acted ex-
pressly in A’s name or by A's order, A would acquire the whole. Sofar
Scaevola Ulpian appears to approve of these opinions and to apply thern
to the case of the two fructuarios. ,

But in D. xnr. 1. 123, Ulpian in a later book of the same treatise
quotes Scaevola as saying in the same second book of his Questions
exactly the reverse on one point. Quam speciem Scaeuola quoque tractat

One of the Greek commentators (Anonymos) on Bas. xv1. 1125 notioes
the discrepancy between our passage and that in D. rav. and proposes to
get rid of it by taking that to relate only to the case of the slave acting in
the name or at the order of the one. A possible explanation seems to be
that suggested by Fuohs (Krit. stad. 1867, p. 15 foll.) that Scaevola
altered his ¹mind in the l3th book, and that the extract in D. xn1.
originally stood r'rr partem adquirat, and lower down at for at.
Fuchs thinks that or being accidentally altered to et led the copyist
(ignorant of D. vn. 1. 125. ξ 6) to alter partem to colobium. I should
