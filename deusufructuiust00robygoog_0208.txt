1130,:31. ' A slave's peculium. ’ 7193

thet when a writer says Marcellus, dvo. scabit, we cannot conclude that
he gives the exact words of the author referred to. The substance is
here accurately given.

quoniam, dvc] The principle is thet the heir must not neutra· ·
liae the gitt of his testator by rendering the house ol the fructuary
uninhabitable, but, subject to this, he can do with his property what
he chooses.

quod usqne adeo temperandum est] ‘which right of raising his ·
own house and obscuring his neighbour's must be so moderately ex·
ereised that, dic.²

l 31. (a) This law is ludicrously out of place between 130 and 132,
if the connexion ol the thought be regarded. But the place was really
determined by totally elien consideratione. It is an extract from Paul’s
loth book on Sabinus and consequently comes efter the extraots from
the third book

(ὁ) The purport of the lew is that ‘cc rc fmcducrii' includes not
merely the fructuary's own goods managed by the slave, but also the
¹ slave's paediam, whether it consisted of giits from the stuctuary or of
money allowed him to use, or of the slave's savings. Legally the predium
still remained part of the property of the fructuary: practically it was
the slave’s, and the acquisitione made out of this peculium would belong
in the same way. This double aspect ol the paediam shewed itsell from
several points of view. As regards dealings with third parties it was the
slave's property and was ansverable for the slave's debts; quasi patri-
monium libori dominia peculium serui intellegitur (D. xv, 1.147.fin.;
l 32. pn). He could even have business with his master as il there were no
domestic relation between them; purohase and sale, letting and hiring,
pledge and suretyship, gilt and ioan, all might take place between the
slave and his master or third party3 just as between one paterfamddre
and another (ib. l 47. § 6; 1493 cf. xxxr11.8.122. ξ 1; xn. 7.114). On
the other hand, the peculium existed, both as a whole, and as regards any
particular things in it, only solong astho master willed (ib. l 4. pr. ; le). But
he could not withdraw it ro as to defraud the slave's crediturs (l 21). He
hed however the right as between himself and other creditore ol the slave,
of deducting payment in full ol his own debt, unless the slave was carrying
on a particrdar trade with the masters knowledge. ln that case the
master oould only claim his proportion (D. x1v. 4. l 1. pr.; 15. ξ 7).
Actione for and against the slave were brought in the masters name
(xv. 1. 144). As the slave might also be acting not for himself but on
behelf ol his master, this lact if proved made the master responsible,
not merely to the limit of the pendium but es ior e debt ol his own.
If the masters own estate had been enriched‚ the suit was dc in rem
uerso (xv. 3); if the debt was on the master’s guaranty, it was quod
iussu (xv, 4); if the slave was merely the manager of a trade carried
on lor his master, or was the captain of his masters ship‚ the master was
