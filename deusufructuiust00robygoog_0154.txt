conceptione based on facts applicablc to things, but they are not except

artificially applicable to rights of way, rights'to unobstructed light, rights

to support, and rights 01 using and taking the fruit. A right 01 way cannot
be continualiy exercised, arighi of light can only be shewn when a person

interieres with it, a usufruet has to exist concurrently with 1110101101

right, dormant only 101 a time, 01 the owner of the thing. Yet in all these

casas there is something anaiogcus to possession, and that is the exorciso

01 the right when the person entitled desines 10 exercise it. But such

exercise, or power of exercise, is not strictly possession (ci D. 1v. 6. 1 23. ᾗ 2

fandi possessiouem ael ususfructus quasi possessiouem amisit); and ac·

cordingly‚ as one aspect or the other is presented 10 -view‚ writers deny
or essert possession of such rights. The Romans denied the applica·
bility 01 usucapion, but they were in equity eventueily driven tc protect it
by long possession, justas they admitted a iuris quasipossesn'a, while they

. denied possessio, just as they spoke sometimes 01 tradere asamfiuctraa,
sometimes 01 iuducere ia sanatam fruendi causa, and in some cases recognised
the right 01 servitude-holders to interdicta for disturbanoe. af. D.V111. 1.

One 'passage of the Digest (xm. 3. 14. 028) says that a teu Scribonia
(date unknown) aboiished eam usucapionem quae seradutem constituebat,
aaa etiam eam quae libertatem praestat sublata seruitute.. When, how long,
and in what way usucapion was thus applicabis to found a servitude we
do not know. Unterholzner (Verjtttraupstetre, §196=1r p. 135 ed. 2)
aptly refers tc Gaius 11. 54 for sn anadogous casa 01 an incorporeal right, ¹
ris. an hereditas, being once regarded as admitting of usucapio, though
afterwards the view was abandoned .

· (a) The passage just quoted from the Digest speaks of 101100010ἰὶ10-
101111010110111, and instances a person, oeoupying under a servitude not to
build higher, who, by building higher and keeping the house so built 101
the required time, establishes his freedom from the servitude. Ii heheu
done this only by permissipn (precario), the servitude would continue (1). vm.
2. l 32. 01.; 4. l 17). All servitudes were lost by non-use, but urban servi-
tudes were not lost unless this non-use was practically enfcrced by the
servient perty's maintaining continuously 101 the required period an otr-
struction. This arises from the nature of the servitudes themselves, which
do not consist in *discontinuous acts 01 the dominant party which have to
be permitted by the servient, but in a continued state 01 light, prospect,

ii the servitude is 10 be destroyed, continuous disturbanoe must be made
by the owner 01 the servient tenement. Other servitudes, vis. nual servi-
tudes 'and personal servitudes, might be destroyed in the same way by
intcrierence on the part 01 the servient party, for this interserente, if sub-

mitted 10, brought the dominant party into the same condition 01 non-
