ll 22, 13. · Mortis cauea delectio. 153

Ι heve ae usufructuary. Ι1 11 be shewn thatl was intended to be
benefited, the aleo when paid to the slave would come to me, not to the
slave's owner.

A gift ot some kind as a condition of benefit undere will is often
mentioned, as imposed upon the heir, or a legatae, or a slave to whom
liberty was granted (ag. 11111111. 1.]44; 2.176pr.; 11111111.6.136;
138). Such a gift received came under the category ο1 math cauea
cupio, which was not identiaal with, but inclusive ο1, morticiacum deviatio
(D. 11111111. 11131).

nam et ln m o. donat] Theline of argument implied in acm is
something of this kind. ‘This is true of a thing given inter uicos, and
it is true also of a gilt in view of death (dormio 11101111 comc); there- ·
fore we may infer it to be true also of those cases of gift which have
analogias to both ’. See also preceding note.

A mortis causa donatio was a gift made usually, but not neces«
sarily, in apprehension ol some impending danger to life, eg. by a man ,
dangerously ill, or about to take a dangerous joumey. The essential
characteristic was that it should take effect only on the giver's death, and,
if the person to whom it was given died first, should bo null. Marcian
defines it epigrammatically: Mortis causo donatio ert, oum qais (11111911)
habere ee uult qaam eam cui donat, magisque cum cui donat qaam heredem
mum (D. xxxix. 6. l l). The gift could be medein any suitable form (man-
cipation, tradition, dte.) and the thing given might either remain with
the donor, or be handed over to the donee, subject to he reclaimed by the
donor, either 11 the donee died first, or (provided such was the under-
standing)‚ 11 the donor changed his mind (ib. l 13 ; 129, dia). In some
respects a m. c. donatio resembled a legaoy, and hence restrictione imposed
on the power of giving and receiving legaoies were extended to gifts in
view of death (of. Gai. 11. 225, 2263 D. xxmx.6. l4a.§ 1). Incaseofthe
donors insolvency, or ο1 a will being set asida in favour of parents or
children, such gista were invalidated (Ι). ib. l 17; xxxvr1.5. l 3pr.).
Ulpian's broad statement in D. xxxin. 6. l 37 probably related only to
the application of the lea Pupia Poppaea, and was made general by
Justinian (Iost. 11. 7. ξ ).

123. stipulando] After treating ο1 the acquisition ο1 things through
a slave, Ulpian proceeds to the acquisition of ongations and the like. By
a stipulation a slave acquires for a‘fruotuary a valid obligation upon which
he can sue3 by a bargain or informal agreement he acquires, not a right
tc sue, but a plea capable of defeating another's suit ; by obtaining a formal
release (occeptum rogando), he acquires for a fructuary the extinction of a
subsisting obligation.

paciscendo] ‘by making a bargain’. A pactum was a verhal agree- .

ment not made in solemn form (stipulatio). 11 11 was made in immediate
connexion witha definite legal contraot, e. g. a loan, deposit, pledge, sele,

hiring, partnership, commission or the like, it was regarded as defining the
