reo promittendi] Qut stipulatur, reus stipalaaali dicitur,· qui pro-
mittit, reas promittendi labetur (D. XLV. 2.1 1). The older form had the

Festus adds, though the 'precise words 010 1101 certain, that in the second
of 11101111. tables(si quid lterum fuit uitium, iudici arbitroue reoue eo dies
di'jfetssus esto) the word is used both 01 plaintiff and defendant. It does
not seem necessary there to 101011110 more than the defendant, though
practice may have extended the application of the law. Cicero says,
Orat. 11. 43. ξ 183, reos appella 11011 eos atoalo qui arpuuutur, secl omues
