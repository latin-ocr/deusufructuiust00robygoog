112. §Z Lease or sale of usufruct. , 83

gives up the use und enjoyment for a period which may exceed that previ-
ously agreed on (for Omay live longer than B), A is entitled to be pro-
tected (either by a plea of fraud or a special plca on the case) against any
claim on the part of B, even ifB outlive U.

uel locare uel uendere] ‘either lease or sell’. In letting or leasing
we retain the property or right, and part only for a time with the use or
enjoyment, receiving in return a lixed hire in money (maces). In selling
we part absolutely with the property or right and receive in return a fixed
price in money (pretium). The purchase-money is usually a sum paid
once for all or else in agreed instalments: ,hire or rent is usually paid 'at
regularly recurring intervals throughout the period of the contract. But
the mode of payment is not apparently of the essence of the contracte.
In the caseofa usufruct sele and lease would differ mainly by the contracta
being for the whole duration of the usufruct or for a limited time (e. g. ’
five years), and in any case would cease on the death or capitia decurtato
of the usufructuary (D. m. 2.19.§1). A bare use (actu) ¹could not be
leased or sold (DVIL 8.18;111;x.3.1 10.§1); buttheleaseorsaleofa

nominal consideration (nummo uno) was adopted as a convenient means
of restoring to awoman after divoree the benefit of a usufruct· which the
owner of the thing had given to the husband as dowry (D. xxxn. 3. 166).
A similar sale nummo uno was at one time the form by which the burden
and benefit were transferred irem an heir to a cestui quc trust (Gai. 11. 252).
Whether the same was applied to the transfer by a legatae of a usufruct

left by way oi trust is not said. In the case of trust-usufructs however
the Praetor eventually treated the legates as a mere channel, and the
usufruct was attached to and endured with the person of the cestui quc trust
just as iforiginally constituted in him. (D. v11. 4. 14; al 9. pr.) [On

Instances occur in Bruns Fontes Pt. 11.1; 2b; e] But in cases oi
regular inheritance it was not possible for a person once an heir to part
with his legal position and put another into his shoes, An inheritance
once accepted was no more alienable than a usufruct. But in both cases
the practical object might be accomplished. The sale of an inheritance
isthe subject of a special title of the Digest (D. xv111. 4). The purchaser of
either inheritance or vrsufruct would bear the burden and take the profits
of the position. Only he would be answerable to the heir or to the
usufructuary for any neglect of duty, and any legal measures against third
parties for the protection of his rights would be taken by or in the name ‚
of the heir or usufructuery, not in his own name. ’
