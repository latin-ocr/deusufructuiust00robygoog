808117111λῆ10 commisit] ‘committed to his honour '‚ ie. created a trust in ·

favour of Titia for the usufruct of one-half of the estate : or, as we should
say, left it to Maevius, as regards one-half in trust ior Titia for her life with
remainder 10 Maevius. The words were originally used in the ordinary
sense (ag. Ter. Eua. 886 Ego mc 1000 marcado et 00000110 1001· Cic.
Ver. 11. 1. 1 1 dc caraea quererere fidei octembres eant, dra), but aiter-
wards became technieal. Some cases mentioned by Cicero shew the way
in which trusts grew up. A. Trebonius had a brother proscribed by Sulla,
and a ler Cornelia forbad aid to be given to the proscribed. Trebonius
. in writing directed his heirs 10 take an cath to give to his brother each one-
hall ol his share. A freedman took the cath: the other heirs deelined.
Verres excluded the freedmen and gave possession to the others. Cicero
concedes the legality ot Verrcs' action, but comments on its inequitable
character (Verr. 1. 47. § 123). Q. Fadius Gallus made P. Sextilius Rufus
his heir, and in his will stated that he had requested the heir to arrange
for the whole inheritance coming 10 the testatore daughter. This was
contrary to the ter Uoconia, which forbade a man registered as having
100‚ooo asses (Gai. 11. 274) making a woman his heir 01 bequeathing to
anyone more than half the estate. Rufus consulted his friends what he
should do: no one recommended him to give more than was allowed
by 1110100· Uoconia, but Cicero implies that he ought morally 10 have
given the whole. Apparently he gave the daughter only hali (11011. 17.
ξ 55). Ο. Plotius made Sex. Peducaeus his heir, and secretly requested
him 1ο hand over the inheritance to his daughter3 which he did (ib. 18.
1 58). Q. Pompeius Rufus (Sulla's grandson) had been condemned in
a criminal trial for violence (de 01) aud was in exile (Dion Cass. xa. 55 ;
Cael ap. Oic. Fam. vm. 1. ξ 4). The prosecutor was M. Caelius Rufirs
Some land was leit to his mother Cornelia with a trust (fidei commissa
praedae) for him, which she did not carry out. Pompeius asked Caelius
10 take up his cause. He did 00, and was successful in a legal trial
(iudicio), of what nature is not stated (Val. Max. IV. 2. ξ 7). Gaius
(11. res-288) enumeratas many matters in which it was possible 10
effect by a trust what was inconvenient 01 impossible to do directly.
Augustus first gave legal sanction 10 trusts by directing 1110 consuls
1ο 01110100 them: eventually a special judge was created 1011110111, called
Praetor· fidei 0001110011οε (lust 11. 23. ξ 1). At first when the law
recognized truste, the heir who was charged with a trust to give up
the inheritance remained legally heir, but by certain contrivances the
benefit and brnden were transferred 10 the 000101 qrc trust This was

gradually simplified (Gai. 11. mosqq.;1nsa 11. 13). The usual words
