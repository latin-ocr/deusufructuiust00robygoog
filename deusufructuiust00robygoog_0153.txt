anelogous institute being adopted A 0100(οω00011001 praecepcio loaqs‘
temporis or 100000 possessionis) wes given 10 a possessor in good 101111 and
with a good commencement 01 possession (1.0. emansores). 110 appli-
cability to moveables was definitely enacted by M. Antoninus Caracalla
(1). 1111. 3. 13;1. 9). The period, fixed apparently bylsome imperial de·
crees (D. xv111. 1. 176. § 1), was ten years if the contesting parties had
been present, twenty 11 absent. Later on, 1101 merely a ples but a right 01
’ action to recover propertyso possessed was granted (God. vn. 34). And
claime 01 mortgegees as well as owners were extinguished by this lengthened
possession without their being pressed (Ood v11. 36).

Justinisn no longer distinguishing between ros menapi andros osec
01000001, between Italian and provincial land, (Caracalla had made all
freemen Roman citizens an. 211, D. 1. 5. l 17), enlarged the period cf
usucapion and fixed the period elika ior all immoveables at ten years imo
praecelsos, twenty inser 01100100 (defining presence, and absence, see above
p. 44), and for moveables at three years. The possession of a predecessor
in title was allowed in all cases tc be counted in the period (Ood. vn. 31;
sal 12). The words usucapio and longo possessio &a 0101011 in the
law writers, but mean 101 Justinian the same thing. -

A still longer period 01 30 and 41) years was allowed by J ustinian to
give not only a plea against claims (as had been practised since Con-
stantine) but also a right 01 0011011, provided only the possession ,had com-
menced in good saith A lawful beginning was not necessary, and stolen
things were (according to most jurists) not excepted ·

, capion (D.v111. 1. l 14. pr. ; xnr. 1. 143. §13 3. 110. ξ l). Notwithstanding
this, we find a number 01 passages in both Digest and Oode in which an
acquisition 01 servitudes (10000 comesetods'ae, doc.) is spoken of as existing:
D. vr11. 2. 128; t. l 10. pr. ss· 0011 dinnao asa et 10000 00001 possessione

15. §33 Ood. 111. 34. l l; 12. The aetion granted was however 011111, and

the right must have arisen therefore under the practice of the courts .

The origin 01 the rig'ht had 1101 10 be proved: it was ¹necessary only that
for οο many years the defendant or claimant had used it and that the use
had been neither by 10100 1101 01001111 1101 permission. Sane et iss sesai-

The cases mentioned are all rural or urban servitudes: but J ustinian (Ood.
v11.33.112. 14) expressly makes his regulative provisions ior bssyi tem-
poris proesmpts'o applicabis to usuirnct as well as to the other servitudes.

The apparent discrepancy between the passages which deny usucapion -
tc servitudes and those which admit protectior to long use is due to the
nature of servitudes themselves. Possession, putting into possession,
turning out of possession, gaining a right by continued 0000000100, 010 all
