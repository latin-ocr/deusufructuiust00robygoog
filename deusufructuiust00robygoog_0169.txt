¹ (5). Βο1 11 11 was subsequent at some interval or stood by itself‚ in·

dependent of any other transaction, it was held not to create an obligation
and consequently gave no right to sue on it ; but, as an agreement mede in
good saith, the Praetor protected it, and so far enforced it as to allow it to
be a valid plea (acceptio) against any one suing in spite 01 11 (D. 11. 14. 1 7.
ξ 7sqq). The title de pactis in the Digestis placed in the part relating to
procedure and hence is mainly occupied with agreements act to sue, and
some introductory matter ol a moro general kind. Hence the doctrine is
appropriate: auda pactio 011190ιὶ0000 aaa parit, sed parit acceptiones

acceptum rogauorrr] Cor-responding to the 0110010011, i. e. the solemn
verbal contract made by question and answer which created an obligati0n‚
was 0 solemn verbal form 01 release from the same, made also by question
and answer‚ here as in other cases the question being put by the party to
be benefited‚ the answer by the party consenting to accept the burden or
waiva the benefit. The debtor secking 0 release acceptum rogauit ; the
creditor granting a release acceptum fecit. The debtor said (10001 ayo tibi
promisi 1010000 acceptam? The creditor answered Habeo (Gai. 111. 169) or
the forms might be Accepta fecistiseam? Facio (D.xnv1.4.17). This
was called acceptilati0‚a term clearly borrowed from bookkeeping‚ and in

this connexion we find acceptum (accepto) ferre used in D. xxr. 2. 14. ξ 1;
00011129. §23 191. §33 and in metaphorical use ‘to credit with '‚ in

Val. Man 11. 7. Est. 23 vin. 2. §33 Sem Ep. 78. § 3. But creptum
(accepto) fucere or fieri, in the sense 01 putting an end to an obligati0n‚ is
found in Cic. Vcrr. 111. 60. ξ 139; Plin. Ep. 11. 4 ; VI. 34 ; and frequently
in the law writers, e. g. Gai. 111. 2153 and indiscriminately with ccc. serre
in Dig. xnv1. 4. The use of accepto (predicative dative 1) is found only in
the law writers.

An acceptilatio was 01 itself a complete release and required no pay-
ment or other satisfaction 01 the debt: U alat 00101000 uidetur is 0010000011-
1011000 solutus est (]).11). 116). Any obligation‚ whether due now or not
till some future time, may be extinguished by this form, by first being
brought into a stipulation (ib. l 8. § 3 ; l 12). At one time it was doubted
whether part of an obligatior] could be thus released (Gai. 11L 172), but
this doubt was removed afterwards. The obligation must however beot
its own nature divisible: thus a release 01 part 01 0 usufruct is valid in
the sense that the usufruct 01 part 01 the estate is releascd‚ but a release 01
part 01 0 right of road is not valid (D. ib. 113. ξ 1). The release itsell
must be present and absolute, not future nor conditional (l 4 ; l 5).
