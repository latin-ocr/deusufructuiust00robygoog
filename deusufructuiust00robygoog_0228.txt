saepius idem legando] ‘by bequeathing the same thing more than
once’, i.e. ιο the same person (cf. D. xxx. 34. ξ 1). 11 the same thing is
left first to one person and then to another (dieimeaim), the ordinary
interpretation would be that each was to have an equal share; but it
might be, 11 the testator clearly so intended, that the first legacy was revoked
by the second, 01,11 the testator clearly so expressed it, that each was
’ ιο have the whole, i. e. one get the thing and the other its value (ib. l 33).
Under the law before Jrrstinian something depended on the form of
the legacy, whether per vindicationem or per clomraotrbaem (Gai. 11.

144. The usufructuary may not of his own right put new plaster on
rough walls. Plaster was regarded as an ornamental, not a necessary,
addition, and consequently money horrowed by a slave and expended
without his masters orders on new plastering was not chargeable against

his master as having been converted ιο his masteds use (io rem 0000001
D. xv. 3.13, ξ 4). Ηο may however repair suoh an ornamental plaster,
if he finds it, and may colour it or paint and otherwise adom it (above,
17. §33 113. ξ 7), but the character of the house or rooms is not to be
chan ed.
