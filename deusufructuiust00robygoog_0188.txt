rather be disposed to think that the words ccipe deditam which do not
appear in the other passages contain some clue to the discrepancy;
and that both opinions were stated by Scaevola, one ss commonly believed
and the other as logically correct; and that the compilers have in our

' passage insufficiently corrected the text. (See the next note.)

Why Scaevola changed his vmind (if his second and thirteenth book
really contained different decisione) is another question. Perhaps because
it was simplet to hold that the whole was acquired by the person whose
property was employed in getting it, than that the otiose owner got part
which afterwards he would have to give up to the boae fide possessor
(cf. D. xcv. 3. l 39). On looking more closely at Ulpian’s words in our
passage, it will be seen that they are very cautious and do not
really say more as regards the fructuary than that whatever isthe
law as regards two possessors in good faith will be law also for two fruc-
tuarios,andthatsofar as in any case the fructuary does not acquire, the
owner will.

partem-domino] Ulpian has evidently written this carelessly‚ or
more probably the compilers have made havoc of it: as it is dependent

¹011 boc faeere at, we ought to have pars ci ...... quaeratur pars dominc.
Ulpian has expressed itas if it were dependent directly on cit; or per-
haps originally these words depended on uolgo creditum, and rationem
efficere introduced a different view see (the last note). The subjunctive
is found rightly in the corresponding passages, D. xm. 1. 123. §Mais
rationem facere ...... at ...... adquirat) and xcv. 3. l 19 (ratio facit cp ......
ailquirat); and Stephanus has it right even in our passage (τὸ εὔλογον
ἀπαιτεῖ ἵνα...με’ρος αὐτῷ προσπορισθῇ). Another pieoe of similar careless-
ness is found a few lines lower down

erit dicendum ut ...... erit quaesitum] ct requires at quaesitam. But

ifthe slave is using for the purpose the fructuary’s property (e. g. lending
his money, selling or hiring out his land or goods, hc), or using (a g. hiring
out) his own services

utrum tunc locum, dec] The subject was introduced in 121 by the
ease of a legacy (si saci ra f. sit lepores), though that passage being taken
from the 17th book of Ulpian’s Commentary on Sabinus and this from
the 18th, one cannot lay much stress upon the point. But the fact,
