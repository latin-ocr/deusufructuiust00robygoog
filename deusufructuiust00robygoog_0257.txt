(D. ιιι. 1. l 44 pr.) iustissime aediles ιοιιιιιιιιι bominem eireiqaue misnia

reason given in our passage as resting on the principle that a slave gained
¹for the fructuary only aa re snsetaarii or er operis ιιιιι, and the offspring
coming under neither head consequently falls to the owner. But the
limitation of the principle itself requires explanation Why is a lamb the
property of the fructuary and a child nott I think the natural explanation
is that, ware being frequent ιιι ιιι slave trade perfectly open, the Romans
locked ratberto getting their slaves ready grown, and not to breeding them.
And when they did breed them, it was apparently for their own use on the
estate, and not for sale. (Of. Varr.Ii.Ii.11.10; ib. l; Colum. 1. 8. ι 19,
dac.) If the child oi a slave-woman was ιο be taken as his own by one
who like a fructuary or bono fide possessa had only a life interest or
temporary connexion, it meant separation from the slave’s family and
from the estate. It would be a breaeh of the domestic character of the
institution, and thus not suited ιο ιιι characteres usufruct as a temporary
provision for the member of a family, and unneoessarily favourahle to a
mere intruder like a borsa Jide possessor. And no doubt there was a
natural willingnsss on the part citha lawyers ιο recognise a distinction
between a bcy or girl on the one hand, and οι ιιι other hand a soal, or call,
or lamb, or puppy, which he might kill or even consume at pleasura
A slave was legally a thing, a chattel, but he was defecto a person, with a
possibility, frequently realised before their eyes, of becoming legally a

mixed character so that an anomaly is to be expected.

hac ratione nec usum fructum, dra] ‘ οι this principle the fruotuary
will not have a usufruct any more than he has a property in the· child '.
A fructuary could use what he found, and vegetable fruits he could gether
and consume (127.pr.). Any produce coming into being afterwards
he could as arula take also as his own, whether the young of animala the
fruits of trees and other vegetable crops, or the produce of mines and
querries. Gradual incrementa such ns the growth of trees, alluvial
deposita, the increased strength, capabilities and valae of the estate or
thing or creaturas, he could use and employ. Buta child born after his
usufruct commenced was under none of these classes The law said
he was nota fimeta, and yet he was a separata and individual thing.
So it was held, as in the case of an island rising in the river and adjacent
