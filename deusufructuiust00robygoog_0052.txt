servitude by legacy he adopts the language suitahle to the legatam per
damrtatioaem(D.vr11. 1.l 16=Just 11. 3. ξ 4), that being the most gene-
rally applicable, and any specific' distinction between the forms of bequest¹
being abolished (Just. 11. 20. ξ 2 ; God. vr. 43. l 1. § ). Ἰ
pactionibus] (a) There is no apparent reason· why the plural shc'uld
be used in this context, ai aaa uelit aaamfrrwtam ceratitaere potest. Nor
have Ι found any instance of it applied to a singular subject¹ in the Digest.
J ustinian’s [1111111111 have it applied in the same words to usufruct in
11. 4. 1 1, and 10 real servitudes in 11. 3. § 4. The latter section is mainly
taken from the same book of Gaius (lter. Cott. 11.) from which our'passaga ·
comes(seeD.VI11. 4. 116). Probably Gaius used the plural, because he
was speaking both of real and personal servitudes, precisely as he does in
11. 31, and Tribonian has cut out real servitudes, as he probably cut out
the distinction between Italian and provincial lande (see above on ctrina
testamento p. 35).

(b) Paetio is, used indifferently with pactam, except in the old phrase
pactam concentum see D. 11.14. Ulpian defines itas damam plattam-
ae ia idem placitam 1011111111, and proceeds 10 explain eontentio as the
most general word applicable to every contact of persons out of which
¹ an obligation arises (ib.l 1). Contractaa is used mainly in opposition to
1111111111, these being the two chief sources of obligation. Parta, pactiones
are used generally of bargains which are not made in the solemn form of
stipulation, nor are denoted by such special names as erratio, 1111111111,
societas, depositam, &a (ib. l 1. ξ 4; 17. 1 1), but are preparatoryor

,ancillary to other contracts (see note on 1 23). InD.n.17.173.§4 '

stipulation‚ the mancipation itself became more and more a form, and,
as the con'tents were reduced to writing, the oral declaration was probably
often abridged or omitted. The contenta, except in case of difference

either of pactam or lea (011111. 14. 17. ξ 5 ea enim pacta ineant, qaae legem . ·
