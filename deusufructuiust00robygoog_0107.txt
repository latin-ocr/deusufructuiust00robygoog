pendentes] ‘still hanging’‚ i.a not yet separated from the trae. Cato,
a a. 146, gives a form of contraot for sale of olea pendeas, and 147 of uisam
perdens, i. e. an ungathered crop of olives, and of grapes. SoD.xv111. 1.

properly applicable to grapes, olives, apples, dra, the latter to corn, grass,

cui condictione teneatur] ‘who has the right of bringing a 0010110110
against him ’. Theft was punishable by the oriminal law (Gai. 111. 189 sq.;
D. xuvn. 2. 1 93), but was also the subject of civil proceedings in an actio
sarci which was of apenal character and subjeeted the defendant, if con-
demned, to infamy (Gai. 1v. 83 182). Further, the thiel was liable in
a personsl action for restitution (condicet) er sosias 00000), and might be
liable in a vindication, and in an aetion ad exhibendam (Gai.1v.4; D.
x111.1.17.§ ).

(a) A aiadieatio could be brought by an owner against the possessor
for the time being, whether the thief himself or one who had got the stolen
property innoeently or guiltily (D. VI. 1. 19). 11 the thief had parted with
the property before the aetion was brought, the aetion did not lie against
him. Parting with it fraudulently, after action brought, left him hable as
before (ib. l 17). The aim of the aetion was to recover the thing with all
that belonged to it, or acorued by reason of it (ib. l 20). But if the thing
was destroyed, e. g. if a slave or animal died, without the possessor's fault,
the action was as a rule only good for the recovery 01 the fruits or other
belongings (ib. 1 15. § 33 l 16).

10 the cese mentioned in the text a usufructuary could not bring
evindication as owner; the fruits were not his before gathering: whether
he could bring the confessario against the thies, who thus interfered with
his rights as usufructmry, is not said (of. D. v1a 6. l 5. ξ 1; 17).

(ὁ) An action ad exhibendam could be brought by any one who had
reasonable ground for requiring the production of a thing (D. x. 4.12;
la. ξ 9); aud against any one who had the actual possession 01 the thing

or had fraudulently parted with it (ib. l 3. ξ 15; 19. pr). In case of non-
produetion the defendant was liable for the value of the plaintiff's interest,
i.e. for what ho loses by its non-production; and this might be more or
less than the velue of the thing (ib. l 9. ἐξ 7, 8; lll. pr). As againsta
