l 57. The usufructuary of an 001010 has the estate bequeathed to him,
and 01101 enjoying it 101 00010 time hes to restore it 10 the son 01 the
testator, who has succeeded in upsetting the will. For the time the
usufruct has been apparently merged in the ownership: but it revives 00
a separate right 00 the owncrship being under these circumstances with-
drawn again. A similar case is given in D. xxxv111. 2. 1 35, where the
ownership was withdrawn by bassorum possessio being granted catara
tabidas. For cases of effectual merger see above l 34. § 23 136. § l.

inofficiosi 1001] The querela inofficiosi testamenti was 0 proceeding
10 have a will annulled on the ground 01 110 being wanting in due respect
to the claims 01 0001 relations. The testator is supposed sofar not
10 have been in his right mind (000 sanae mentis, D. v. 2. 1 5), 11 he
passed over or disinherited one who had a claim and was not undeserving.
Such a claim, if proved, was good on behalf 01 children impeaching their
parents' will, or 01 00100101100000111001110110111111000 ; or as between bro·
thers and sisters; but only if and 00 101 as the claimant would be the heir
or an heir, if the testator had died intestata (ib.ll; 16. ξ l ; 115. § 2). The
claim was defeated, if the claimant received under the will 01 10 contempla-
tion of the testatore death 0 fourth 01 the inheritence 01101 debts and
funeral expenses and the velue 01 slaves manumitted were deducted.
If there were more persons in the 0001001ᾶο1010000000100,00011 could
only claim his share 01 the fourth (l 8. §b 6-9; 1 25). Any action 01 the
claimant under the will, or in recognition 0111 as valid, forfeited his claim
(123. 1 1; 112. 12). This suit was in addition to other remedius,
especially 10 the right 01 claiming the bonoram possessio castra tababzs
(above, p. 214 sq.). But an emancipated son passed over in his father’s
will could not impeach 1110 will, if his own 000 still in the grandfather's
power was made heir (l 23. 01). 00 the other hand the beatorem possessio
was 001 open to 0 disinherited child (D. xxxvn. 4. 1 8. pn). A will pro·
nounced undutiful was null for all purposes, legasies and frcedorns included
(D. v. 2. 18. ἓ 16). Δ
