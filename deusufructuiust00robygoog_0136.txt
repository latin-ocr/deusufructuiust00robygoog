1111· bonus] ie. 0 nian desirous 01 exercising his right with due modera-
11011 and discretiori. See above on l 9. pr. (pp. 67, 66). ’

§b scaenicae uestis...u01 aulaei, dec] The singular is used col-
lectively, as 01100 in D. xxxm. 2. See note cn l 9. § 7, 0010 (p. 76).
‘Stag'e dress 0100110100, 01 other 0100011100 ’.

01 accolanarum, oe] The usufructuary will be entitled tolet them
out 101 hire, if a usufruct of such things be left him, generally: and further
even though the testator only lent them and did not hire them, 01111 the
fructuary will be allowed 10 hire them out. Stage dress is evidently rarely
01 use to most persons, unless they can hire it out, and the difference
between aeae and ususfructnr would come almost 10 nothing, 11110 could
,1101 take the ‘produce’ by letting them for hire.

commodare] ‘to lend' a thing. 11 10 opposed 10 marauna 010νο, because
the thing itself, not its equivalent, is to be returned (01010001 domas, 000
eandem 00001010 qaam dedimus-alioquin conamodatern erit 001 depositum
0001 idern 00000 D. xn. l. 12. 01.) and opposed 10 locare, because that is 10
grant the use 01 a thing 101 money, commodare is gratuitous (J 001, 111. 14.
12. fin). According 10 Labeo it was applicable only to moveables, hut
this view was not accepted (D. xrn. 6. l 1. § 1). See above onl 12. ξ 2,
precario (p. 84).

' ipsum fruct] The force 01 10001010 01 first sight difficultto see. But

10010100 1000110011 not have surprised one; ‘the testator himself' ie.
as opposed 10 his successor the fructuary. So 100010 fruet. is the fructuary
himself as opposed to his predecessor the testator.
’ funebrem uestem] 1. e. the robes and couch coverings required 101 the
bier and 110111 01 1000111010. Such things were probably often kept ready
by undertakers and 101 001 101 the occasion. Black dress was mourning,
though (Plut. 1200001. Rom. 26) 111 the imperial time women wore white
(Marquardt, Prie. Aa. p. 346). Of. Paul. Seni. Ι. 21. § 14 Qui 10001, abaci
nere debet 0 concinite, ornamentis, perpera, 01 0160 00010.

§a ita utentem, ne, 110] This expression 10 ambiguous. (1) Stephanus
takes 0100 as the proprietor. ‘The 0100110101 must not hindar the fructu-
ary in 1110 000, 11 11 be so guarded as not to put the 0100110101 in a worse
position’. With this use 01110 qualified 1100010001 compare 110...00
0110010010 §a (2) The German translator makes 0100 10101 10 the thing
used. (3) Another mode would be to take 0100 01 the fructuary and make
the 0100110101 subject to factat. Then 110 would refer to the kind 01 use
previously described by Ulpian 00 the proper one 101 the fructuary. ‘The
0100110101 must not hindar the fructuary in such ause, lest by so hindering
he put the fructuary in a worse position’. At the end 01 this law, taken
11111116, and in 117. ξ l we have 00 01010101 000011οἰ010 expressly referred
to the fructuary, and apparently presuming it to have been already stated.
1 0111 consequently inclined 10 this third view and to regard §6 as com-
mencing a new division 01 the subject by laying down ageneral 1010 101
the 0100110101 corresponding to the general 1010 laid down for the fructuary
