de modo 1111111111 1111111111]1ο1 the mode 11 keeping m repair'· ‚
ie. of the nature and amount of repaire which he is bound to do. Oe
D. vm. 5.16. §2 Etiam de seruitute, qnae 1111111 serendi 11111 imposito
erit, aetio nobie competit, nt et onera ferat 11 aedificio 1111111 ool enm
modurn qni 1111111111 imposito conprehensae 111, i.e. 1ο the extent im·
plied by the nature of the servitude. The obligation was 1ο keep the
thing in the stete it wes when he received it, and this involves due repeir:
but if the building was so bad that it fell of itself (without any negli-
genoe on the psit ο1 the usufruetuary), rebuilding would put it into 1
far better state, and that is not pert of the usufruetumy's duty. Ι1 the
buildings are only incidental to the estate of which the fructuary has the
use, he would continue to use the estate3 if the building isitself that of
whioh he has the use, the use dies with the extinction of the building
(D.v114.15. 12). The ease put just above ο1 the heir rebuilding and
still allowing the fruetuery to enjoy, is clearly applieahle only where the
buildings are not themselves the sole object of the 1111111111, and where
consequently the 1111111111 does not die with the building. The ambiguity
'of reficere( repairing' or ‘rebuilding ') has led to a corruption of the text of
D. xxxlx. 2. l 20, where non pertinet is true it rebuilding 11 meant by re-
. ferire, and the Florentino us. and Bes. 11111111 the negative. But eine
ipsine seems to requires duty of the buetuary, end therefore Mommsen
is right in proposiug to omit non (11. Gliick, 111 p. 254).

siquae-mmm] i.e. ‘the measure of the fruetuary’s duty to repair
becomes an important question if he is not obliged to rebuild what hes
fallen from ege. What then ishe bound to dol' (Si...ooqitnris not s
dependent question‘asks whether he is compellable '.) Α

ad eum pertinet] ‘belongs to him ‘‚ in this ease, as burden; more
usually the word is used of 1111111111, e. g. l 9 poesin. See note on pertinet,
