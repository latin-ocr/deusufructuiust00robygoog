the do loeo bequest was met by the testator, instead of at 0000 conveyin g
the property by will 10 the legatee, imposing (per damnationem) 00 his heir·
the duty of putting the legatae into possession. 'l'he difficulty as regards
the conveyance inter ainos was met in a similar way. A bargain (pactio)

, Ι was made, and in order that it might be legally enfcrceable, the bargain

was ratified by a formal stipulaticn. The bargain, ies the statement
of the right intended to be created, and the conditione thereos, was in fact
the material portion of a surrender in court or of a mancipation, minus the
solemn procedure. In lieu of this solemn procedure, a stipulation was
added lt is natural to suppose that, just as in the bequest per damnatio-
11010, the nstanrs words were followed by a quasi-delivery on the part of
the heir, so in this case the spoken bargain was followed or accompanied
by a quasi-delivery.v But'was such a quasi-delivery necessary 10 the valid
establishment 01 the usufructl It is not said so; and the opinions of
' modern y'urists are greatly divided on the question. It was not, after
iustinian, necessary in cese of a legecy; for any and every legates by
iustinian’s constitution (uod. vr. 43. l 1. ξ 1) had the right to bring

n nicanora and therefore a complete title, and hev could call· on the

heir 10 give him the dc facto enjoyment. There are, however, no such
positive words in the case 01 an establishment of a usufruct 101ον aium. ,

. ' of his right, the fructuary was put or came into actual possession 01 the

land, he would have a right to the protection afforded by the interdicte
(D. v111. 1. l 20), eg. the interciatam ori possidens (D. 11111. 17.1 4),and

ditione) to the actio Publiciana (D. vr. 2. l 11. t 1 ; cf. D. xn111. 18). These
interdicte were called orites, ie. not strictly legal, but ‘practically available'
· because the possession 01 the fructuary was not a possession as owner
(Vat. Fr. 90-92); and moreover, so far as provinciale were concerned,

‘ was outside of the civil law. whether, without thus being in physical
Ι possession, the fructuary could by the for'ce of bargain and stiprdation have

an action not only against the promiser and his heirs, but also against the

· assignee 01 the promiser 011 against any other owner of the reversicn, is a

question not easily determinable (cf. D. 11011. 7.1e; v11.e.13. t 4). See

Both the forms of mancipation and surrender in court went out of use
before J ustinian, though the word 1000010010 was used in law-deeds after-
wards, apparently merely as an old term. The actual ceremonies probably
ceased in the fourth century, a shadow of mancipation remaining 101
'a time in solemn delivery before five witnesses (Voigt na 110111015-

and noc ozoncipi (Cod. vn. 31); and when speaking of establishinga
