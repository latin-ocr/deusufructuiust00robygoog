legislator that property should be in active use and enjoyment‚ if not by

eise of) a usufruct belonging to A there will be a user, namely B, and A’s
gift is so far from being any evidence of abandonment that to treet it as
abandonmeut would imply that a man gives only what he does not care tc
keep.

negotium meum aereas] A person who took upon himself to act for
another without being asked by him was said regeriam alienum gerere. If
his services were beneficial, he had a right 01 action against the other (whose
business he was doing) for the expenses and liabilities incurred in the duc
conduct 01 such business3 while the other had an action against him to
compe] him to account for any profits received and to make good any

damage accruing from hie unlicensed interfercnce (D. 111. 5. 12 ; xu1v.7.
l 5. pn). The cause of such an interfercnce is usually the absence or ignor·

anco 01 aman, and the risk ethis interesta being injured by neglect or

, delay(ib.). The agent was liable for fraud and fault, but not for the un·

successful issue of his action, if the action itself was not contrary to the
principal’s intentione (D. 111. 5. 193 110; lll. §13 lla. 011319). Rati-

, fication bytho principal did not change the characteres the action into

one 01 mandati (ib. l 8).
In the proposed case the usufructuary retains the muhuct because it is

, represented by the rent, which is the same evidence of enjoyment, whether

the letting was conducted by the usufructuary himself or by another acting
on his behalf and accountable to him.

locauero] The Greek Steph. confirma this reading (ist pera* sing).
Mommsen suggests locauerdt. But bccccrit would refer to the person ·
capotium mecm peram mentioned in the previous sentence, and thus would
not bc consistent with a fresh mention of the same person again (chromo ct
iprwrarte-qcia), or would lead to the awkwardness 01 having two such
persons spoken 01. I see no objection whatever to lococcro. Ulpian takes

’ first the case of letting, divided into two, myself letting, or another letting

ξ 3. fugitiuus] A runaway slave was one who left his masters house,
or concealed himself, with the intention of withdrawing himself from his
masters service altogether. A definition ofa fugitive is given for the
purposes 01 the aediles' edict in D. xxa 1.117. The retaking 01 fugitive
