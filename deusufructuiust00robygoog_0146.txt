The actio de dolo was introduced by O. Aquilius in tha time 01 Cicero
who often mentions it; e. g. Off. 111. § 50. Aquilius defined dolas malac
as ceam esset 011001 simulatam aliad actam. Similarly Servius Labeo
blamed this definition because it made pretence (simulatio) necessary to '
ground the action,and 011 pretence wrongful His own definitior, approved
by Ulpian, is omm'a calliditas fallacia machinatio ad armamaamtam
fallendam damplaadam alteram adbibita (D. 1v. 3. 11. 1 1). The action
