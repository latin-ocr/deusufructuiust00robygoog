si tu id fueris, epo apere utili actione possum: ad 001000 euim corruptelas
tneo actio pertinet (l 9. 1 1). 11 0 01010 1100 the offender, he might be snr-
rendered 00000 111 lieu 01 damages (l 5. ξ 4).

iniuriarum] (0) A right 01 0011011 101 outrage was given by the
1111 tables. Broken limbs and blows were punished with fines; libel with
death. The Praetors developed the action 01111 modified the penalty,
leaving it 10 the judge to fix (Gall. xx. 1. ξ 12 sqq.; 31 sqq). Outrage
included all 0010, 01 purposed insult 10 the person either cf oneself or 01
those under one’s power, or tc one’s personal dignity or reputation. Blows,
forcible entry into one's house, attempts at seduction, indecent address
to women, withdrawal 01 their attendants, pelting with mnd, libel, public
abuse, attacks on reputatiou by treating a 111011 as adebtor who is 1101 00,
01 advertising his gocds 101 0010, wrcngsully putting a slave tc the turture
with a view 10 insult his master, and many other 0010 gave'this right 01
0011011 (Gai. 1v. rac-me ; Paul. deut, v. 43 1). 111111. 1,0; cf. Keller lust.
ξ 162). The right remaincd even 11 the owner had parted with the slave
or set him free (D. n. 3. l 29). The damages were assessed by the injured
party, subject to reduction by the judgcs (cai. 111. 224).

(b) The statement in the text however appears to be in conflict with
D. xnvn. 10. 115. 5 37, where in commenting 0111110 edict Qui 0010001 alie·
uum 01000101 tonos mores ucrbcrauissc, deuo eo iniussu domiai quaestionum
1101101100, dicetur, iu cum iudicium dubo Ulpian says Noc si fructuarius id
fecerit [10. 0001000001), dominus 0001 eo opit, uei si proprietarius fecerit,
frucctaurius euru conueniet. No doubt strictly these words only relate tc
uerberare, but the context (1000 not apparently J‘ustify any distinction
in this point of view between beating and putting 10 question with torture,
Probably Paulus is referring to excessive 10111110, 01 10111110 without
reasonable ground (01 D. 111111, 10. 115. § 42),Ι and Ulpian is denying
the responsibility 01 fructuary to owner 01 nt owner 10 fructuary for
beating (01 torturing) 0 01010 in circumstances which justify nn owner
or quasi-owner, and (10 not J'ustily 0 third person. indeed it would
be unlikely that a fructuary should rnJ'nre 1110 01010, 01 which he had the
use, with the intention 01 thereby insulting the owner.

(c 0) Several actions being thus open 10 the injured party, the question
arose whether he might use one only or all. Some held 11101 the plaintiff

had 10 elect which he should take, and the right to bring the others thus
dropped (011000 electa atteram 00010011). Ρο111110 says (01 10 made 10 say in
1110 Digest 111111. 7. l 34. pn), that it was eventually held 11101110 might
bring 111110110011011110 pleased without thereby forfeiting his right 10
bring another, but the damages in the second action would be cut down 10
so much only as exceeded what he recovered in the first action (ib. 1323 ,
1343141; 153). This applied when it was the same deed which formed
the subject 01011 the actions. Repeated 0010 subjected the offender
tc repeated 011110. 111 the three kinds 01 00110110 mentioned here there
