heire person and will remain with him, 'only se long as he lives, and has
not his ‘head broken ¹, and continues te use it J avolenus (by the words
ia aas persone) apparently wishes to guard against the idea thet there
is only ene usufruet in question, via that attached contingently to the
persona ei Titius, and that this usufruct will live and die with Titius,
though actually enjoyed by the heir. The usufruet was net an estate for
the life ef Titius and consequently now held by the heir par autre uic.
The person of the testater's heir, net that ef Titius, is now concerned.

spectandum id erit, quod, dra] All depende on the understanding

restitui a uenditare] The usufinet was with the heir, who was

induxerit, p. 35. Fer restituere see note en p. 47.

155. infantis] See note on l 12. 1 3, p. 87. The infant here is ef
course 0 slave. The age of seven which was applied te define infancy
in some cases would suit this passage fairly well. He could hardly
be of use before that age.¹

usus tantummode] Why is the ‘use’ only mentioned, and indeed

emphasized, as if in opposition te ususfructus? And why is the extract
placed here instead ef in title 81 Ι cannot answer these questions.

The ‘use' of a slave included tho persenal services of the slave fer
the usuary and his family, and a slave was a legal ehaunel fer the acqui-

sition by the usuary ef property by stipulation or delivery, provided
that the usuary’s property was employed fer the purpose. But the
usuary had no right to hire eut the slave's services, and could net there-
fore acquire anything in remuneratien fer them. In short the usuary
could through the slave acquire ea· re sua, but not eu operis serui (D. vn.
8112. ξ 5-1 14; 116. ξ 2). To aet as stipulant or receiver was a
service which could not be performed by an infant: but time only was
required te bring about the possibility of such a use. And the expectation
it appears was sufficient to support alegacy ef use; and a fortiori to
supporta legacyolusufruct. A slight foundation was enough, as we
may see froml4l andlb3.

For the subject matter of this extract compare l 101 3; and Paul.

Gaius forming D. xxx111. 2. l 8, but there confined 10 bequest. 81000-
