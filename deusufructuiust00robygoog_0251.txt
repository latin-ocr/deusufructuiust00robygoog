quoque] i.e. not merely the same total number but the same number of
'each kind.

adsignare] ‘assign¹‚ ‘make over'‚ ‘ allot '. The word ia frequently used
in this sense, no actual marking or sealing being implied‚ though this was
probably the original meaning. Any action which indicated the appro-
priation of things to a particular person would presumably suffice. Itis
used (1) of making out and allottiug particular lands to veterana or others,
eg. in lac Agraria (Bruns, p. 69), qaod cyri nicia· dedit adsignauit ; D. vr.
1. 1 15 ; &c.; (2) of assigning the several parts or articles of an estate to the
several heirs, D. x. a] 22. ξ l; and especially (3) of assigning the several
freedmen to the several children who would then on the fathers death
become their patrous (D. xxxvm. 4): of this it is said αιίείρπανε qaia

’ 1963. This law referstothe case of aman granting the usufmct of an
estate of which he is the owner at a time when the usuhuct is lying out in
another man. The actual exercise oi the right so granted would come
into play only on the loss of it by the present holder.¹ Thai this is the .
meaning of the law is confirmed by Bas. τὴν γὰρ χρῆσιν τοῦ ἀγροῦ μου, ἣν
ἕτερος ἔχει, παραχωρεῖν ἄλλῳ δύναμαι. And so the commentatam, only that
Stephanus also mentionees possible another explanation, viz. that an
owner in establishing a usufruot is conveying what is not his, because the
enjoyment is not with him a separate servitude (cf. D. vn. 6. l 5. pn). But
this explanation would make the law into a mere empty ,riddle and be
'inconsistent with its place in Paulus' ireatise deicere 1111911111νὶ from
which it is extracted. 172 gives a similar rule respecting bequests oi
usufruct.

doubt that is the reason for the case being treated in Paulus' work da iure
angulari, which Paulus defined thus, iae singulare est qaod contra ratiarnam

cedere] Paulusne doubt meantia iare cedere (Gai. 11. 243 30). Sur-
'render in court and mancipation were old statutable actions, and such did
‘not admit of limitatione of time and condition (D. n. 11111). Accord-
ingly doubts were entertained (see above, p. 196) whether a usufruct could
