lm. Ι 11 slave be made heir or legates? 151

miraeus, possidere aliquam reue et usucapere possimus, quaa mrum aaa
possidemus (Gai. ib. 94). Ulpian however had no doubt: Per euuu iu quo
usumfructum iubemus possedere posmraus, sieut eu operis suis adquirere
uobis solet,· uec ad reue pertinet, quod ipsum uou possidemus: aaut uec
filium (D. ib. § 8). The doubt expressed by Gaius was omitted by
iustinian when transferring this part 01 Gaius to his Digest (XLI. 1.
llo). But this doubt was not solitary. Thatamancould acquire pos·
session through a child iu potestate was clear: but the family included
also persons iu amau (a wife) and iu mauupia In Gaius’ time there was
adoubt about these (Gai. 11. 90). The relations having 1111001110 obsoleta,
J ustinian had no need to solve this question.

The question was specially important before iustinian, because legat
possession was the condition of usucapion; and usucapion was much
relied 011 10 heal defects in conveyance, such as transfer by mere
dclivery 01 what ought 10 be transferred by mancipation. On manci-
paticn being abolished the defeat 01 title 111 the transferor was tha chief
thing which might interfere with an ordinary transfer 01 property. But
the full length 01 possession required for the interdicis contributed to the
importunae of the question of possession.

si nero heres institutus sit uel legatum acceperit] A slave
could acquire nothing as his own in the eye of the law, He 0011111 not
hold as owner. Ifa slave was made heir by his owner's will, the institu-
tion was null, unless he was made free uiso. Otherwise both slave and
inheritance would be without an owner. If another person’s slave was
made heir, the master could direct him to enter, and on the slave'sentering
1111011110 himself at once heir through tha instrumentality of the slave
(1), xxrx. 2. l 79). Similarly a legacy to another man's slave was in effect
alegacy to the slave's master. But if the slave was in usufruct, is the
usufructuary or the bare owner to benefiti Most lawyers answered
broadly, that entrance on an inheritance or acceptance 01 a legacy was not
within either of the categorias which entitled the usufructuary to acquire
through the slave, and that consequently the owner, not the fructuary,
took the inheritance or legacy. So Gaius 11. 91 (=D.Xn1. 1.Ι 1110. ξ 3;
Just. 11. 9. ξ 4); Ulpian D. XXIX. 2. 125 pr.; ef. lieq. X1X.20; Julian
(D. XXIX. 2. 145. ξ 3) and Paulus (D. 11111147). Both these last give the ’
reason that aduio hereditates uou est iu opera seruili (D. XXIX. 1. 145 pn).
A formal legal act 01 entry on an inheritance cannot be regarded as
aslave's service. But J ulian in the same passage (§ 4) throws out the sug-
gestion that, if, as some asserted, and he admits to be possible, a bouayide
possessor 01 a freeman in the guise 01 a slave cen direct him to enter on an
inheritance to which he has been instituted on the supposed masters ac-
count, the reason is that such an acquisition must be deemed to be eu re

doueiui. How it can be so is not clear. It is not because the intention of
the testator is conceived as already giving the moster an equitable title:
for that would imply an acquisitiones what is alrealy (equitably) my
