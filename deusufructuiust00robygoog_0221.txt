nihilo magis] It seems 10 have been thought that as the intended
fructuary did not, and could not, actually uti fiai, this was equivalent
10 010 having 0000011 ati ‚frui Το which Julian answers that the assump-
tion is incorreot: tho legatae did ati frui, but iu another form, cf.

interuentu] ‘on the occurrencc’ which as it were interseras with the

136. pr. The difference between the two cases mentioned here is
this. An area is simply an unoccupied piace 01 ground, and is not altered
by a building having been erected on it, if the building 10 110 longer
there, when the legacy veste. But the usufruct 01 0 building is not
the usufruct of any and every building, but 01 0 specific building, and
on the destruction of that specific building the legacy becomes void An
0100 occupied by a building 10 an area no longer, and 0 building destroyed
10 01 0011100 a building no longer, and therefore the usufruct in both of
them is impossible (cf. D. xxx. 147. § 4 ; §6; 1111). In D. vn. 4.15.§a;
§33 110. §1 we have the same rule applied to the continuance 01

· 0 duly-constituted usufruct, which is herc applied to the existence

0111 at all. The rule is different as regards 0 legacy 01 the things
themselves and not merely of the usufruct 01 them. The bequest 01
an 0100 carries with it any buildings erected on it (D. xxx1.l39);
the bequest 01 0 building however is not valid, if the whole building be
new since the will was mede, and not merely repaired gradually 011100111-
pletely (D. xxx. l 65.§ ).

existimauit] via. the lawyer consulted on the question, whether Afri-
canus himself or not. Mommsen, Z. R. G. lx. p. 90, is inclined to think
that Africanus reported the opinions 01 Julian, and hence usually we
have the third person, not the first. But the first and third persons
are both found in other writers, perhaps, as Mommsen suggests, from
misinterpreting an abbreviation.
