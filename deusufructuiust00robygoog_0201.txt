In practice there would olten be little differenee between the two, as a
promise to constitutas servitude would probably be treated as sufficient
without any furtherproceeding, just as in England an agreement ior a
lease or partnership, dra, is osten acted on, without the deed ever being
drawn or exacuted. Our passage seems so parallel to the question dis·
eussed by Marcellus in vrrr. 4. l 611166 I take itthe testator had promised

to granta servitude, and Ulpian gives it as his opinion (pato dicendum
is in lc. putot perstandum), that the fructuary must permit the servitude
to be exercised Indeed the heir would have a right to impone it formally
before patting the fructuary into his right (D. m. l 116. t 4), and would
not have to compensate the fructuary, for the 1161111661 would be held to
have been bequeathed subject to that condition.

t 5. si sernas sub poena, 66] Occasionally certam condiuons were
imposed when a slave was sold. Four such are specially treated 61 ; (o)
' that the slave should, 61161 a certain time, or on arriving at a certain age,
be set free; (b) that a woman should not be prostituted; (c) that the slave
should not bc set free3 (d) that the slave should be removed and should
not return toa particular place See' the titles D. xv111. 7; 06111155-
57. In all these cases a pecuniary penalty (aab poena) for breach was
sometimes stipulated: but in the first case the slave became free without
the purchaser’s act at the time stated. This was by a constitution 6111,

xnv. l. l lan. §Q Ood.1v. 57. l 6). In the second cese the seller stiprdated

Praetor, isthe seller consented to the prostitution (D. xn. 8. 17; nod. 1v.

ohesers consent, the seller should have the right manus 1611616 61 abducere,

claimed him as slave (V at. Fr. 63 cod. 1v. 55. l 1). This condition was
