, (Gai. 11. 204). Α usufructuary did not possess in the strict sense, ¹for
he did not hold, or claim 10 hold, as owner: but he of course had, or was ι

entitled to have, the physical possession of that 01 which he had 1110
usufruet. Gaius says (11. 93) usufmeetuarius non possidet, sed labet ius
utendi fmeeruli. Ulpian (ll. Χ. 2111 1) speaks of him quimusy‘iuctus ¹
nomine rem taient, quamuis nec lu'c utique possideat ,· and again (D. xt111.
16. 1 3. 5 11) Qui ususfinetus nomine qualiterqualiter fuit quasi 11100001- ’
sione, utetur loc 'interdicto; and again, non possidet legatum, sed potius fruitur
(1101111911). The heir has so far as possible to 011001 this. Ι1 the owner-
ship of the land is not in the heir, either as part of his own estate, or of that
of the testator and not bequeathed away from him, the heir has to ‘induet'
the legatee 01 the usufruct, 10. put hini into the de facto possession. If the
ownership of the estate is in 1110 heir, it is only necessary that patiatur eum
utifrul.

2. 129) Siquis usumfructum, leqatum sibi, alii restituere roqatus sit, eumque
eju fundum inducerit fruendi causa,· ‘and by Ulpian (D. xn111. 4. 13. pr.)
Si quis 11011 fuerit iu possessionem fideicommissi 0110111 causa et nou
