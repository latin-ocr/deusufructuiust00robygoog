of power. (comp. F. schoman’svicwin eierasse.) While the usufruct
lssts, the estate may be slightly modified or improved, butmay not be
deteriorated either by owner or fructuary. This being Ulpian's view,
Paulus qualifies it only by suggesting that there may be servitudes which
from their own nature may hc imposed without impeiring the thing ior
the fructuary, e. g. that hs should not raise his house higher: for thisis

just what the fructuary is actually prevented from doing hythe law of his

, position (l 13. ξ i). It is possible enough that the stiff forms of the early

modes ol conveyanco may have contributed to give this stiff unaltcrablc
character to a usufruct, but Ulpian’s doctrine seems to bc a deductiori
' from the tvvo rules that the proprietor may not impair the position of the
fructuary‚ and that the fructuary is not to alter the character and position
oi the thing used In l 13.§ dno allusion is made to tha possibility oi
’ consent. The discussion is directed to the right only.
