moveables was not the one ruling the Romu} notions on' these matters. '

They probably felt the inconvenience 01 these special modes 01 conveyance,
and extended them no further than they could help. They classed pro·

' vincial landa with ros nec menapi, as they classed camels and elephante
with rea noo menapi, ior the simple reason that neither being known when
the form of monopteroe was the regular conveyance ior all important
property, sentiment did not require the application 01 this form, and
convenience forbed its extension. But they did not give up the claim to
ownership‚ because they refused to force the use 01 a burdensome convey- Ι
ance, and they holdas Roman citizens what they acquired by mere delivery‚ .
whether moveable or immoveable, if it was not included in the limited
number 01 things which formed the early Roman formare holding and
stock. and which were only pnrted with under the solemn forms of an
ancient ceremonial.

(t) Ido not laystress in this argument on the occasional use in the ¹.
Vatioan fragments of the terms dominoe‚dominiom(§§ 315, 316) or prognie- Ι .

toa (ξ 315) applied to stipendiary lands, for these words might be used
somewhat loosely 01 what all recognised· to be de scoto ownership. Nor oan
much support be drawn from the fact that, even if the provincial lunds
were held only as a usufruct, still usuiruots were capable 01 being ·
vindicated (D. vn. 6. l 5. § l); for, as I have shown, this would bs taking ·
Gaius’language too literally. Nor do Ι ‹lisouss whether any form 01
bequest, the same as, or similar to, that by the words do lego (see note ori' ,
1 19. pu), was used by the provinciale. All that I question is whether
there is any sufficient reason for supposing that a bequest, by a Roman

’. citizen to a Roman citizen, in the words do lego, of an estateinthe provinces,

subject to tax, would have been invnlid even before the passing of tha
senate'sdecreein Nero’stime. ·

lure legati] There is a special title on the subject 01 bequests 01
usufruct and the like, D. xxx111. 2. Bequest was evidently the principol
way 01 treating a usufruot, and very probably the earliest. See note on
125. ξ 7. Tho desire 01 providing according to their several ages and .
needs for the members 01 a testator's family naturally led to the practice
of giving a life interest in certain property to some, while giving the
property itself, subject to the life interest, to others.
