= (c) ¹The creation 01 servitudes in connexion with the delivery 01 land is
often spoken 01 ag. Haec lea traditionis ‘etiltmidia miniaceam ut ita

· ducem liceret: recte esse seruitutem impositam ait, manime si pact o e tepidatio Ι
catecumina. 133. pn). See l 32 below. It 10 however not improbable
thet in these passages Tribonian hes substituted traditio, tradendo 101·
umacipatio, maaapaiedo. At least in Vat. Fr. 47 Paulus says 0 11011-
11001 could not be reserved in making a delivery 01 0 non-mancipable
thing, because delivery was not an action 01 the civil law (Elvera p. 706 n).
And such 0 change from mancepare to tradere has actually been made
111 D.V11. 2. l 3. ξ 1, as may be seen 011 referring to the original in Vat. Fr.
80. A similar change would account 101 the generality 01 Gaius’ statement,
as given inD. II. 14. 148 Ia traditionibus rerum, quodcumqae pactam eit,

We 1111101 distinguish two things: a bargain or stipulation 10 grant a
servitude, and a bargain 01 stipulation actually granting it. It might

' , , easily occur that the precise limitatione 01 the servitude required 001110

investigation‚ but the general intention 01 the two parties could be 01 once
expressed. This would be the subject 01 epactam. If the parties or their
representatives (sons cr slaves) could meet, it might be confirmed bya
stipulation,⁴ But such a bargain or stipulation would be preparatory to the
formal constitution 01 the servitude; 01. D. VIII. 4. l 5. § 3a where the
obligation to grant 0 servitude is expressly distinguished from the imposi-
tion and existence 010 servitude; xIV. 1. l 136. i I. Whether such a
preparatory bargain or stipulation was made cr not, the constituting 001
would apparently be a bargain, confirmed by 0 stipulation, in which the
· 0110 party claimed and the other promised (according to the servitude
in question) uti fred sibi (1.0. simulatori) licere, 01 ire apere eibi laedique
licere (01. D. 111. 1. 1 38 esp. §b 10-12), with the linuit 01111110, if any, and .
specification 01 the thing or piece 01 0110111111 10 be enjoyed or the direntiou
of the road, or any other suitable limitatione (D. VIII. l. l 4; 15; le. ξ 53

· ’ XIV. 1. l 115. pr, 110). 01 the form might be aeque per te (1.0. promissorem)

neque per heredem taam fleri, quominus mibi mtifrai (or ire opere, 110.) recte
licem (D. xcv, 1. l 49. ξ( 1, 2 ; 175. ξ 7. pn). The former of these forms
10 apparently the more sweeping in its 1011110, but practically meant, no
more than the latter: aman could promise only 101 1111110011 and his 110110,
bc, not for all the world (111111. 1. 1 38. pn). It 1100 usual however 10
