31 Dare. 13. pr.

(Gai. 1v. 84> or guardian (ib. 85). It is frequently used of the aetion
of the Emperor, senate, pecple, or other legislative authority (D. 1. 2. l 2,
passim· 3. l 3, 1 8, 1 11, &at
ut heres iubeatur dare] 'l'hcse¹ words point to a legaey per· domna·
, tionem whieh is thus described by Gaius 11. 201 Per damrzalioaem hoc
modo legamus, ‘Heres meos Stielana aeuum meum dare damrmr'esto': sed
et si ‘cleto’ 1011010οι fuerit, per damnationem legatum ert. See also above,
p. 28, bottom. The differente between the two forms of legaey,· that
by do layo and that by teres dare· damnor eila, was⁸ in fact the difference
between giving a right 10 the thing, and giving a claim on the heir: the
former gave a real title (0101111011οῂ the latter a persone] obligation; the
former legatae said rem meam esre ,· the latter heredem rem dore operiere.
dare] The English word ‘give' corresponds fairly with dore, except
,that olore does not imply, as ‘give’ sometimes does, ‘give gratuitously’
‘make a present 'of’. That is donare or denodare (Darnis. 5.1 1. pr.;
saw. 7. 1 3, § 1). Dare is the opposite of accipere, and means ‘to grant’ or
‘make over' from oneself 10 another in wide extent 01 application, either of
incorporeal things, eg. darc responsum, lestinmnium, operas, ueniam, caueam,
libertatem, priuilegium, imo, actionem, exceptionem, usumfructum, iter (‘right
’ 01 road') &c.; or of persons appointed, eg. dare tutorem, iadicem or of
corporeal things, the context alone deoiding the purpose 01 the business,
eg. libellariam, ‘give in a petition'; pecualem, ‘pay over money’
(D. ΧΠ. 4; soluere would imply a previously existing debt); 01010001,οτ
mutuam pecaniam, ‘pay over money in erchange’ for money afterwards to
be paid back, ie. ‘to make a loan', the property in the coins being con-
. veyed3 rem cicadam, ‘to lend' (D. xnr. 6. 11. ξ 1); rem defodiendam, ‘to
deposit for safe keeping' (D. xvr. 3. 1 1. pr.) ; rem pignori ‘to pledge' ¹
(D. xm. 7. 1 1). See Bdcking Pand. ξ 83 li. Dare is frequently used
in opposition to facere, eg. D. mx. 5. l 5pr.; so especially in stipula-
tions and in the forms used in personal actions, in both of whioh it meant
a transfer of the property in athing((}ai.111. 993 Iv. 4; D. xer. l. 150.
§l; 1126. ξ 1; xnvr. l. l ta ᾗ 10, dcc). The word occurs in both the
priucipal forms of legacy, that which gave areal action having the words
. do, lego ,· that giving a personal aetion against the heir on the will ’
(D. XLIV. 7. 1 5. ξ 2) having-beree dore damnor esto or lieres clato (Gai. 11.
193, 201). This use of olo with another more specific verb is like the form
used 01 grants of public lendin full ownership to private persons declat
“. adsignauit (Lea Apron. 3, 7,11, 16, dm), which was so teehnieal that it was
Ι inscribed on the boundary-stones, ‘datar odeiyrrotas' (Sic. Flaoo. in (irem,
p. 156, ed. Lachm.). It will be seen that the general meaning of dare ‘give
over ¹, ‘convey ', isin each case made more definite bytho addition ofa prc-
cise term (adsignare, lepore, pigriori, 01010001, olendum, custodiendum, tta).
intellegitur, si induxerit] The meaning of clare would naturally vary
with the subject of the legacy. If a landed estate was left (not per 01001110-
tionem) the heirwould convey the property and give the legatae possession.
