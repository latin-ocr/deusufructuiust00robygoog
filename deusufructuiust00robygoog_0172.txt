sqq.; Obligat. 1. ξ 28, p. 300). Waohten Erdrter. 11. p. 69, and Bboking,
, Paad. 1. p. 289, refer praestare specially to obligations arising from censen-
sual eontracta. Dare and faeere aro regularly used in formulae: prae·

stare, as Savigny remarks, is not found in the intentio of any of the formulae
preserved to us.

sl ei soluatur, fluctuatio aequm] It was an essential principle of a
stipulation that it was valid only, if you stipulated for something to be done
or given to yourself (D. 1. 17. 1 73. ξ 4). The exceptione to this rule, more
apparent than real, were these:

1. Persons under the same power could stipulata in favour of their
'master or of each other ; and the master oould stipulate in favour of tham.
In all cases the benefit came direotly to the master.¹ D. xnv. 1. 138 Alteri

, 2. A person might stipulata for something in favour of another if it
was for his own interest that that other should be so benefited, e. g. for
payment to be made on his bahali to a creditor, or if a retiring guardian
stipulates from his aoguardians for the proper administration of the ward's
property3 or if one under an obligation stipulatas with a third person to
perform the oovenants for him ; or if a man stiprdates ior the payment &a
to his own procurator (11111111. §§ 20-23). .

3. Α man may stipulata in favour of himself and his heir, e. g. for a
right of road. The heir oau sue on..the stipulation as well as himself.
There is here a continuity of person. (D. ib. ἕξ 12-150111 perarma
1111119111 quisleredispersoraam potest.) 1
. 4. riman may stipulata in favour of himself andan outsider. In this
oasa all agreed that the outsider got nothing 3 but there was, as Gaius tells
us (11. 103), a doubt whether the stipulator could sue for the whole or only
for ahalf. The latter opinion prevailed (Pompon. D. xnv. 1. l 110 pr.
si 111711 et rato, 11 11111 potestate aaa 1111, stipuler darem, 111 1111 decem

5. Α man may stipulate in favour of himself, or au outsider; The
outsider required no rights, but payment to him was good payment and
freed the promiser. In faot it was taken that the outsider was put into
the stipulation for the greater convenienoe of payment, the real interest
being that of the stipulator, who however thus authorised the outsider to
give a receipt (D. xnvr. 3. 1 10 Quod stipadatas ¹ita 1111 ι111711 111 rata,
