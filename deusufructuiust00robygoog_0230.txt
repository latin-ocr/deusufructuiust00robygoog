his brothers into the possession (D. xxxvr1.4.13. § 11; la. (14).
What has been said 0100110 is true also 01 daughters and 01 all descend·
ants, who in the order of intestata succession would have been sai tasas
111101 emancipated (D. xxxvn. 4. ll. § 1). Emancipated children were
thus put 0111110 same footing 00 regards their fathers will with children
io aaa potestate. But the praetor in thus recognizing natural claime
which the testator had ignored, guarded against thereby doing violence to
other natural claims which the testator had recognized. 111110 will was
thus upset, the legaoies would fall with it So the praetor protected
legaoies in favour 01 children and their descendants and of parents, and
legaoies on account 01 dowry to a wife 01 daughter-inlaw (D. xxxvn. 5.
11). A person claiming the possession against the will could not take
0 legacy as well (l 5. ξ 7). And further, any child so claiming the pos·
session had to share with such children -01 the same grade 00 were
instituted heirs any property which he himself had (D. xxxma 11
·1 l. pr.; ib. ξ 24; 001101. xva 7. ξ 2). Α child in the 10010101θο power,
11 named heir, was liable 10 any legaoies charged on him, and if with those
who were passed over he received possession 01 the property, he would share ,
with them 1110 payment 01 the protected legaoies, but 00 that 1110101-
cidian fourth was reserved 101 the heir, and the legaoies were abated
so that no legatee should get more than a child (D. xxxvn. 5. 114. ξ 1;
16). Α child in the testator’s power, 11 passed over, sueceeded 1ο the
possession 0011 110 will had been made, and the legaoies, 11 there were
no other heir on whom the legaoies were charged, fell altogether (ib.
115. pn). A child dirinherited could do nothing except impeach the will
01 undutiiulness (ib. l 8. pr.; see note below on l 57).

In 1110 0000 mentioned in the text a stranger is instituted heir: an
emancipated son is passed over. Whether any other son was instituted
heir also is not said; apparently not. The emancipated son claims his
rights and obtains the 1100010111 possessio. The stranger is ousted altogether.
The deceased had bequeathed to his mother the property in something (it

, 10 1101 told us in what) reserving the usufruct. The bequest would be

maintained. The usufruct thus reserved would have belonged tc the heir
01 110110 instituted hythe will: as the will' is upset, who isto have this
usufructt the son as ele facto in the position 01 110111 01 the mother as
having the ownership (or reversion) 01 the thing? For the son it might
be argued that anything not specifically bequeathed fell 10 the heir; and
the son was now put by the praetor into the heir’s shoes. For the mother
it might be urged that the usufruct had been reserved only for the benefit
01 the heir appointed by the testator, and certainly not 101 the son whom
the testator had passed over altogether z consequently it would escheat to
the proprietary, ie. to the mother (0001 36. ξ 1). However, regard for the
duty 01 0 son 10 his mother decided the point in favour 01 the mother, who
would receive the full ownership. Godefroi refers 10 another decision

made pietates 1010110 (D. xxm. 14'1. § ).
