Savigny says municipes is the term most generally used for a community
and was applied to a colony as well as a municipium properly so called
(Spst. 11. p. 249).

aetio dari debeat] The doubt was not due so much to the difficulty oi
getting over any absence of due formality in constituting the usufruct, as
to the apparent incongruity ol a strictly personal right, which was always
terminated by the death or loss oi civil position of the holder, being
recognised in a body which did not die and was not likely to lose its
position in the state.

considered analogous in a community to eapitis deminutio in the case of a
man. Carthage on the other hand was utterly destroyed App. ite.

to the death oi a man, D. vn. 4.1 21 Si ususfructus ciuitati leqetur

slleoque quasi morte desinit labere mum fructum. ef. Hor. oa. 1. 16. 20.
When Gaius says a burgher-community will not die, he merely means
to contrast the continuans ideal life ol a corporation with the limited
physical life of a man. Possibly he would have regarded Carthege as
havingundergone, not death, but cap. dern. murima

not the property ol the citizens, the community was allowed to bring

and even agaim those who placed them there; Tenedi dues erum et
